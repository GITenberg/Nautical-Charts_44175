<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>In preparing the material for a lecture on Charts for
Columbia University, the writer was impressed with the
fact that although nautical charts are mentioned or discussed
in many publications, there was not found any one
which covered the general subject of their origin, construction,
and use. In the countries of the world more
than a million copies of such charts are now issued
annually. A considerable portion of the human race is
interested directly or indirectly, whether as mariners
or passengers or shippers, in navigation upon the sea.
Aside from supplying a handbook for those who might
have a general interest in the subject, it was thought
that a discussion of charts might lead to further consideration
of the principles governing their construction.</p>

<p>This paper has intentionally been made as non-technical
as seemed feasible in treating a somewhat
technical subject. The writer is indebted to the Coast
and Geodetic Survey for various illustrative material
from its archives, and to a number of authors for facts
or suggestions. A list is appended of books and papers
which have been freely consulted, bearing on this and
related subjects.</p>

<h2><a name="CHARTS_AND_MAPS" id="CHARTS_AND_MAPS">CHARTS AND MAPS</a></h2>


<p><b>Need of maps.</b> Maps are useful and necessary for
many purposes. Only by means of a correct map
or globe can a clear idea of the geography of a region
be given. An attempt to convey the same information
by a written description would in comparison be both
cumbersome and obscure. Even by passing over an
extensive region a man unaided by instruments will
obtain only a rather crude notion of the relations, which
he could clearly see on a good map. The importance
among the human arts of the making of maps is indicated
by the references to them in very early historical
records, and by the skill in map drawing shown by
some of the primitive peoples of to-day. This skill
exists particularly among races whose mode of life
gives them a wide horizon, as for instance the Eskimos.
An interesting instance of this was the case of Joe, an
Eskimo guide, who, in 1898, before the surveys of the
Yukon delta were made, drew a map of the Yukon
mouths with much more complete information than any
previously available.</p>

<p>Without attempting to enumerate in detail the special
uses for maps, in the broader sense they may be said
to be essential for commercial, engineering, military,
scientific, educational, and political purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Early geography and map making.</b> The oldest map
known is a plan of gold mines in Nubia, drawn on a
papyrus. This is of the thirteenth century <small>B.C.</small>, and
was found in Egypt.</p>

<p>In the earliest historic times men believed the earth
to be a flat surface of nearly circular outline, a natural
inference for those with limited outlook and communication.
Later the idea was introduced of the ocean as
a river bounding the earth disk. The spherical theory
of the earth was, however, early accepted by learned
men, and was demonstrated by Aristotle (384 to
322 <small>B.C.</small>), who used as proofs the earth's shadow on the
moon, and the change in the visibility of the stars in
traveling north or south. Crates constructed a terrestrial
globe in the second century <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>There is no Greek or Latin map extant of earlier
date than the time of Ptolemy, but there are references
showing that maps were in use. One of the first of
such passages in Greek literature is the interesting
comment of Herodotus written in the fifth century <small>B.C.</small>,
"but I laugh when I see many who already have drawn
the circuits of the earth, without any right understanding
thereof. Thus they draw Oceanus flowing round the
earth, which is circular, as though turned by a lathe,
and they make Asia equal to Europe."</p>

<p>A map of the world was drawn by Anaximander,
560 <small>B.C.</small> A hundred years later Democritus drew a
map having an oblong shape, and taught that the width
of the world from east to west was one and a half times
its extent from north to south, a conclusion based on
his travels eastward as far as India. This theory,
which was for a time accepted, has left an enduring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
mark in the words <i>longitude</i> and <i>latitude</i>, originally
signifying the length and the breadth of the earth.</p>

<p>The first application of astronomy to geography was
made by Pytheas, who about 326 <small>B.C.</small> obtained the latitude
of Marseilles by an observation of the altitude of the
sun. Dicearchus in 310 <small>B.C.</small> determined the first parallel
of latitude by noting places where on the same day the
sun cast shadows of equal length from pillars of equal
height. Eratosthenes (276 to 196 <small>B.C.</small>) was the first
to compute the circumference of the earth from observations
of the altitude of the sun at Alexandria and at
Syene in Upper Egypt and an estimation of the distance
between these two places. Ptolemy, a Greek of Alexandria,
in the years from 127 to 151 <small>A.D.</small> wrote extensively
on geographic subjects, and collected into systematic
form all geographic knowledge then existing; he was
the greatest geographer of early history.</p>

<p>In the ten centuries which followed, part of the early
advance in this science was obscured, and the theory
that the earth was a flat disk surrounded by the sea
again became prevalent. The voyages of discovery
of the middle ages, however, led to a rapid development
of geographic knowledge.</p>

<p>The flattening of the spherical earth was not suspected
until in 1672 a clock regulated to beat seconds
at Paris, when taken to Cayenne near the equator was
found to lose two and one-half minutes a day. Newton
proved that this was due to the fact that the earth
is an oblate spheroid. In 1735 accurate measurements
were undertaken to determine the size and shape of
the earth. The equatorial diameter has been found
to be 7926.6 miles and the polar diameter 7899.6 miles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
the difference, or 27 statute miles, being the amount of
the flattening at the poles.</p>

<p><b>The first sailing directions.</b> The early Greek and
Roman writers do not allude to charts or maps intended
especially for the use of seafarers. There are, however,
extant several peripli or descriptions of the coast. Some
of these appear certainly to have been intended for use
as nautical guides, corresponding to the modern sailing
directions. It is probable that they were explanatory
of or accompanied by coast charts, now lost.
They are of interest therefore as being probably the first
compilations for the guidance of seamen. One of the
earliest, written apparently in the fifth and fourth
centuries <small>B.C.</small>, is entitled "Scylax of Caryanda, his
circumnavigation of the sea of the inhabited part of
Europe and Asia and Libya." It contains a systematic
description of the coasts of the Mediterranean, Black
Sea, and part of the west coast of Africa. The following
are some extracts which indicate the character
of the work. It is to be noted that no bearings are
given, and that distances are usually stated by day's
sail: Africa is referred to as Libya.</p>

<p>"Europe. I shall begin from the Pillars of Hercules
in Europe and continue to the Pillars of Hercules in
Libya, and as far as the land of the great Ethiopians.
The Pillars of Hercules are opposite each other, and are
distant from each other by one day's sail.... From
Thonis the voyage to Pharos, a desert island (good
harborage but no drinking water), is 150 stadia. In
Pharos are many harbors. But ships water at the
Marian mere, for it is drinkable.... From Chersonesus
is one day's sail; but from Naustathmus to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the harbor of Cyrene, 100 stadia. But from the harbor
to Cyrene, 80 stadia; for Cyrene is inland. These
harbors are always fit for putting into. And there are
other refuges at little islands, and anchorages and many
beaches, in the district between.... After the isthmus
is Carthage, a city of the Ph&#339;nicians, and a harbor.
Sailing along from Hermæa it is half a day to Carthage.
There are islands off the Hermæan cape, Pontia island
and Cosyrus. From Hermæa to Cosyrus is a day's
sail. Beyond the Hermæan cape, towards the rising
sun, are three islands belonging to this shore, inhabited
by Carthaginians; the city and harbor of Melite, the
city of Gaulus, and Lampas; this has two or three
towers.... The sailing along Libya from the Canopic
mouth in Egypt to the Pillars of Hercules ... takes
74 days if one coast round the bays.... From the
cape of Hermæa extend great reefs, that is, from Libya
towards Europe, not rising above the sea; it washes
over them at times.... From Thymiateria one sails
to cape Soloes, which juts far into the sea. But all
this district of Libya is very famous and very sacred....
This whole coasting from the Pillars of Hercules to
Cerne Island takes twelve days. The parts beyond the
isle of Cerne are no longer navigable because of shoals,
mud, and sea-weed. This sea-weed has the width of
a palm, and is sharp towards the points, so as to prick."</p>

<p>That there were many other similar writings in the
following centuries is shown by the following quotation
from Marcianus, in a preface to sailing directions
written in the fifth century <small>A.D.</small>: "This I write after
having gone through many sailing directions, and spent
much time on their examination. For it behooves all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
who are men of education, to scrutinise such attempts
at learning in this subject, so as neither rashly to believe
the things that are said, nor incredulously to set their
private opinions against the careful decisions of others."</p>

<p>The oldest extant sailing directions of the middle
ages bear date 1306 to 1320.</p>

<p><b>Development of chart making.</b> The application of
the compass to nautical use in the twelfth century
<small>A.D.</small> had a marked effect in encouraging voyages of
exploration, and therefore indirectly on chart making.
The following, written toward the close of the twelfth
century, is the first known mention of the use of the
compass in Europe: "The sailors, moreover, as they sail
over the sea, when in cloudy weather they cannot longer
profit by the light of the sun, or when the world is
wrapped in the darkness of the shades of night, and
they are ignorant to what part of the horizon the prow
is directed, place the needle over the magnet, which
is whirled round in a circle, until, when the motion
ceases, the point of it (the needle) looks to the north."
The nautical compass of that time appears to have
consisted of a magnetized needle, floated in a vessel
of water by a cork or reed, and having no index
nor compass card. Peregrinus in 1269 made notable
improvements in the compass, including a pivot suspension
for the needle, a graduation, a lubber line,
and an azimuth bar for sighting on the sun or other
object.</p>

<p>Nautical charts are known to have been in use since
the thirteenth century <small>A.D.</small>, but the earliest extant of
which the date can be fixed is Vesconte's loxodromic
chart of 1311.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>The loxodromic charts first appeared in Italy, and
were so called from the fact that they were crossed by
loxodromes (or rhumb lines) radiating from a number
of crossing points distributed regularly over the map.
Compass roses carefully drawn were later added at these
crossing points, the first appearing on a chart of 1375.
The earliest known mention of the variation of the
compass from true north was on the first voyage of
Columbus, who discovered this important fact in 1492,
and as a consequence his "seamen were terrified and
dismayed." Before that time it was assumed in Europe
that the compass pointed "true to the north pole."
The apparent failure to detect the variation earlier was
doubtless to some extent due to its small amount at
that time along the Mediterranean. The earlier charts
showed both lines and compass roses apparently
oriented with the true meridian, though there is some
evidence to indicate that they were actually oriented
with the magnetic meridian, the designer not recognizing
any difference. The variation of the compass was first
marked on a map in 1532 and on a printed chart in
1595, but the placing of magnetic compasses on charts
did not become customary until about fifty years ago.
These early charts were drawn on parchment, using
bright colors. They were copied by hand, one from
another, with gradual variations. They had no projections,
and the draftsmen evidently had no idea of
the sphericity of the earth. Islands and points were
usually exaggerated; shallows were indicated, but no
soundings; no information was given as to the interior
of the countries; a scale of distances was nearly always
provided.</p>

<p>Charts were first printed about 1477, and are known
to have been engraved on copper by 1560.</p>

<p>The maps of Ptolemy were ruled with degree lines,
but no chart was so provided until 1427; by 1500,
however, most charts were graduated. Before this
date it is not known on what projection the charts
were constructed. On the first graduated charts the
degree lines were equidistant parallel straight lines
cutting each other at right angles and thus dividing
the chart into equal squares or rectangles. These
were known as "plain charts." This square projection
had little to commend it save simplicity of construction,
as in higher latitudes it gave neither directions nor
distances correctly. The difficulties of its use in navigation
were early recognized, and nautical works contained
chapters on "sailing by the plain chart, and the
uncertainties thereof."</p>

<p>The example of early chart making shown in <a href="#Fig2">Fig. 2</a>
is of great interest as being the earliest extant chart
which includes America. This chart was drawn on
ox-hide in 1500 by Juan de la Cosa, who accompanied
Columbus on his first voyage as master of his flagship,
and on his second voyage as cartographer. The chart,
of which only a portion is shown here, purports to
cover the entire world; it joins Asia and America as one
continent, the Pacific Ocean being then still unknown.</p>

<p>Gerhard Krämer, a Flemish map-maker, better
known by his Latin name of Mercator, in 1569 published
his famous Universal Map. In this map the
meridians and parallels were still straight lines intersecting
at right angles, but the distances between the
parallels were increased with increasing latitude in
such proportion that a rhumb line, or line cutting the
meridians at a constant angle, would appear on the
map as a straight line. Mercator never explained
the construction of his chart, and as the above condition
was not accurately carried out, it is thought that the
chart was drawn by comparing a terrestrial globe
with a "plain chart." After examination of a mercator
chart in 1590, Edward Wright developed the correct
principles on which such a chart should be
constructed, and published in 1599 his treatise "The
Correction of Certain Errors in Navigation." It took
nearly a century to bring this chart into use, and even
in the middle of the eighteenth century nautical writers
complain that "some prefer the plain chart."</p>

<p>The Arcano del Mare, 1646, was the first marine
atlas in which all the maps were drawn on the mercator
projection.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
charts and sailing directions were often bound together
in large volumes. These usually had quaint titles, not
overburdened with modesty, of which the following is
an example: "The Lightning Columne, or Sea-Mirrour,
containing the Sea-Coasts of the Northern, Eastern,
and Western Navigation. Setting forth in divers
necessaire Sea-Cards, all the Ports, Rivers, Bayes,
Roads, Depths, and Sands. Very curiously placed on
its due Polus height furnished. With the Discoveries
of the chief Countries and on what Cours and Distance
they lay one from another. Never there to fore
so Clearly laid open, and here and there very diligently
bettered and augmented for the use of all Seamen.

Amsterdam. Printed by Casparus Loots-Man, Bookseller
in the Loots-Man, upon the Water. Anno 1697.

<p>In 1633 a cartographer was appointed to the States-General
of Holland, and it was his duty to correct the
charts from the ships' logs. The Dutch at an early
date made important progress in publishing charts.
In 1720 there was established in Paris by order of the
king, a central chart office ("dépôt des cartes et plans,
journaux et mémoires concernant la navigation"), and
in 1737 the first charts were published by this office.
Detailed surveys of the coast of France were commenced
in 1816.</p>

<p>In 1740 "the commissioners for the discovery of
longitude at sea" were authorized by Parliament to
expend money on the survey of the coasts of Great
Britain, this commission having been created in 1713.
Various rewards were offered by this commission,
including one of £10,000, for the discovery of a method
of determining the longitude within 60 miles, an interesting
side light on the uncertainties of navigation at
that time. Compensated timepieces, which have been
so important a factor in improving navigation, were
invented by Harrison about 1761.</p>

<p>In 1795, by an Order in Council, a Hydrographical
Office was established in London, "to take charge and
custody of such plans and charts as then were, or should
thereafter be, deposited in the Admiralty, and to select
and compile such information as might appear to be
requisite for the purpose of improving navigation."
This office had at first one assistant and one draftsman.
Before that time many charts of a private or semiofficial
character had been published; the catalogue of
the East India Company in 1786 included 347 charts.</p>

<p>In 1807 the Congress of the United States authorized
the President "to cause a survey to be taken of the
coasts of the United States, in which shall be designated
the islands and shoals, with the roads or places of
anchorage, within twenty leagues of any part of the
shores of the United States; and also the respective
courses and distances between the principal capes, or
headlands, together with such other matters as he may
deem proper for completing an accurate chart of every
part of the coasts within the extent aforesaid." This
law was the origin of the present United States Coast
and Geodetic Survey, now under the Department of
Commerce and Labor.</p>

<p>In 1841 a systematic survey of the Great Lakes was
commenced; this is the Survey of the Northern and
Northwestern Lakes, briefly known as the Lake Survey,
conducted under the Corps of Engineers.</p>

<p>In 1866 the United States Hydrographic Office was
established under the Navy Department "for the
improvement of the means for navigating safely the
vessels of the Navy, and of the mercantile marine, by
providing under the authority of the Secretary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the Navy, accurate and cheap nautical charts, sailing
directions, navigators, and manuals of instructions for
the use of all vessels of the United States, and for the
benefit and use of navigation generally."</p>

<p><b>Systematic surveying and chart making</b> date back
little more than a century, and most of the information
shown on modern charts has been gathered in that
time. At present all the principal maritime nations of
the world have made, or are extending, careful surveys
of their own coasts.</p>

<p>Several of the countries have added valuable contributions
in the examination of other regions and oceanic
areas beyond their borders. The maritime and colonial
interests of Great Britain impelled that nation to carry
on extensive surveys along coasts whose inhabitants
were not prepared to do this work in the earlier days;
the British have made surveys along the coasts of Asia
and Africa and a part of South America, and the resulting
charts have been a very important and not sufficiently
known contribution to commercial intercourse
among the nations, as well as to geography.</p>

<p>The Dutch, French, Spanish, and other European
governments have made nautical surveys in various
parts of the world, largely in connection with their own
colonies, and in recent years much useful work has
been done by vessels of the German government. The
United States has also beyond its own territory made
valuable additions to hydrographic knowledge in the
work of officers of the Navy in a number of oceanic
exploring expeditions, and surveys on the coasts of
Mexico and in the West Indies, and in the explorations
of Fish Commission vessels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 16-17]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Extension of maritime surveys.</b> Of the total area of
the earth's surface, 51,886,000 square miles is land and
145,054,000 square miles is sea. The oceans thus
occupy nearly three-fourths of the whole surface, affording
highways open to the nations. To conduct international
commerce by water the ships of one country
must enter the ports of another. Thus both on the
open sea and in the harbors there is an interest, common
to seamen of all nationalities, in the advance of marine
surveys and in the publication of charts.</p>

<p>To keep the coasts properly charted, as well as lighted
and buoyed, is an obligation devolving on modern
nations, not only for the benefit of their own commerce
but for that of other countries.</p>

<p>As shown below, only a small part of the coast line
of the world is thoroughly surveyed. In the extensive
ocean areas which are dotted with islands or reefs, a large
amount of work is required for their sufficient charting,
although many doubtful areas have been cleared up in
recent years. Even the parts that are known to be of
depths so great as to be free from navigational dangers
should be sounded over sufficiently to develop the general
configuration of the ocean bottom.</p>

<p>Through international understanding a thorough
exploration of all the water area of the globe and the
coasts may in time be effected, and the many doubtful
spots which still disfigure the charts may be either
eliminated or definitely located.</p>

<p><b>Present state of progress of hydrographic surveys.</b> A
comparatively small proportion of the coasts of the
world can be considered as completely surveyed at the
present time, and even such regions require much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
additional revision. In the class of more thoroughly
surveyed coasts should be included the Atlantic and
most of the Pacific coast of the United States, Porto
Rico, nearly all the coasts of Europe, Algeria, and
portions of the coasts of Japan, the Philippine Islands,
and India.</p>

<p>A large part of the world's coasts has been surveyed
incompletely, but sufficiently well to permit the publication
of navigational charts. This is the condition as
respects most of southeastern Alaska and some other
portions of the Alaskan coast, British Columbia, most
of Mexico, Central America, the West Indies, Brazil
and parts of Chile, the Hawaiian Islands, China, Malay
Peninsula, Siam, the Dutch East Indies, Australia,
New Zealand, Persia, Arabia, most of Africa, Iceland,
northern Scandinavia, and Finland.</p>

<p>Another considerable portion of the coasts has not
been surveyed, but has been covered by explorations
which have been embodied in nautical charts of varied
degrees of incompleteness. In this class are the north
coast and considerable portions of the south and west
coasts of Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, Siberia, most of
the oceanic groups in the Pacific, the northern coasts
of Europe and North America, Greenland, the west
coast of South America, Venezuela, and Argentina.</p>

<p>Only a very small proportion of the total length of
coasts is now entirely unexplored, and such portions
are confined to the polar regions.</p>

<p><b>Chart publications of various nations.</b> There are
about eighteen nations publishing navigational charts,
and adding to the information on which charts are
based. Many of these nations republish to some extent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the charts prepared by the others. Great Britain has
kept up a series of charts covering all parts of the world
and practically including in some form all information
published elsewhere. This series now (1908) includes
3725 different charts, of which the annual issue is
about 600,000 copies. France (1906) publishes 2948
different charts.</p>

<p>In the United States, charts are published by the
Coast and Geodetic Survey for the coasts and tidal
waters of the main country and the insular possessions,
by the Hydrographic Office for oceanic areas and foreign
coasts, and by the Lake Survey for the Great Lakes.
The total number of different charts issued by these
bureaus is about 2300, and the total annual issue is
about 225,000 copies.</p>

<p><b>Systems in use on various charts.</b></p>

<p><i>Longitude.</i> The first chart of New York, published
by the Coast Survey in 1844, was referred to the City
Hall of New York as the initial longitude, and some
years ago it was the prevailing custom for each nation
to use a local initial longitude. While this satisfied
local pride it led to much geographical and navigational
confusion. Happily the charts of all countries
are now referred to Greenwich, with the following
exceptions:</p>

<p class="exeptlist">
France refers to Paris, which is 2° 20´ 15´´ E. of Greenwich.<br />
Spain refers to San Fernando, which is 6° 12´ 20´´ W. of Greenwich.<br />
Portugal refers to Lisbon, which is 9° 08´ 24´´ W. of Greenwich.</p>

<p><i>Units for depths.</i> The English fathom or foot is used
for depths on the charts of Great Britain, the United
States, and Japan. Russia uses the sajene of seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
English feet. On the modern charts of practically all
the other countries the meter is used, though on older
charts various units are found.</p>

<p>In the first group feet are ordinarily found only on
large scale or local charts of areas with moderate
depths, and the other charts are in fathoms, except
that on the earlier charts of the Coast and Geodetic
Survey feet were used on a sanded surface inside of the
three-fathom curve and fathoms on the white surface
outside of that curve. Heights are stated in feet on
the charts of the first group.</p>

<p><i>Plane of reference.</i> As the depth of water varies
with the tide, it is necessary for charting purposes to
adopt some standard plane to which the soundings are
referred. Practically all countries have adopted for
this purpose a low stage of the tide, as this is obviously
on the side of safety; in most cases an extreme low
water is used, so that the actual depths will seldom,
owing to the tide, be less than those shown on the chart.
The definite reference planes used on the American
charts will be mentioned later.</p>

<p>On nearly all charts heights are referred to mean high
water, doubtless owing to this being the visible limit of
the land at high tide. On topographic maps of the
interior, the heights are referred to mean sea level,
which plane is of course lower than the preceding by
one-half the range of tide.</p>

<p><i>Symbols on charts.</i> Fair uniformity as to general
principles, with differences as to details in carrying
them out, exists on the various series of charts regarding
their general arrangement and the more important
symbols, such as in the shading of land to distinguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
from water, the use of depth curves, the representation
of hills by shade or contour, the indication of shoals
and dangers, and of lighthouses and buoys.</p>

<p><b>Desirability of uniformity in charts.</b> Ships engaged
in international commerce must enter foreign ports.
As the information is constantly changing and charts
are being corrected or improved, it is sometimes
desirable for the navigator to consult the local foreign
charts, and it may often be necessary for him to carry
in his chart room the charts of several different countries.
There are therefore important advantages in
international uniformity in chart publication.</p>

<p>There should be a common initial longitude, and as
the longitude of Greenwich has been so extensively
adopted, it appears quite probable that its use may
some day become universal.</p>

<p>A common unit for soundings and heights would be
very desirable, but the fact that a large group of nations
has united on the metric system, while a small group
with great commercial interests retains another system,
makes the attainment of uniformity difficult.</p>

<p>Substantial agreement as to the use of symbols on
charts, particularly such as represent aids or dangers
to navigation, would be desirable and doubtless feasible.</p>

<p><b>Privately published charts.</b> Many of the earlier charts
were prepared and published by private enterprise, and
such charts are still published, as, for instance, the so-called
"blue-back" charts printed in London. These
charts have usually differed from those published by
the various governments either in representing the main
features in a very bold manner with little detail or in
including a considerable area with many plans on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
single large sheet backed for permanency. An objection
to the latter is that the durability together with the
high price tends to keep an old chart in use long after
it is out of date. It would be financially difficult for
a private firm to give the service that a government does
in the matter of correcting the charts and issuing new
editions, and this is an important consideration in the
selection of charts.</p>

<p><b>Purpose of charts.</b> The main purpose of charts is to
furnish graphical guides to aid in taking a vessel safely
from one port to another; they are maps for the use of
navigators. An experienced mariner may be able to
steer his vessel over a familiar course without charts,
but this does not make their publication less necessary.
Even such an expert pilot doubtless studied the charts
in the first place; the uncertainties of the sea and
the changes of information are such that his vessel's
equipment should include the latest charts, and safety
requires their examination. The passengers and the
merchants who intrust their lives or their goods to the
sea are largely dependent upon the correctness of
the charts.</p>

<p>Besides their main purpose charts fill many other
needs, among which are; for preliminary planning of
harbor improvements and various engineering works,
for defensive works and other military uses, for the
fishing interests, and for general information as to the
coastal regions. Charts will furnish much of interest
and instruction to the traveler by sea and the dweller
near the coast, who will learn to read them. Passenger
steamers should more often for the interest of their
patrons display charts of the waters traversed. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
written or verbal description can give as clear an idea
of geographical features and relations as a good map
or chart.</p>

<p>As the charts are revised from time to time, a comparison
of editions at different dates furnishes a record
of the changes wrought by nature or man, and this is
especially useful in studying the action in many harbor
and river entrances, as well as for historical purposes.</p>

<p><b>Requirements for charts.</b> As charts are maps of the
water areas, including the adjoining land, and intended
primarily for the use of mariners, they differ in important
respects from topographic maps or general maps,
even such as include the water areas. The main
requirements for charts are these; correct and complete
information, early publication of new data, clear and
intelligible representation of the information, convenient
arrangement as navigational instruments, and high
standard of publication.</p>

<p>The special and sometimes difficult conditions under
which charts must be used on shipboard call for good
judgment throughout their preparation. Even the
paper on which they are printed is of importance, in
order that they may be sufficiently durable and suitable
for plotting.</p>

<p><b>Information given on charts.</b> It is evident that it is
impossible to represent on a chart of any practicable
scale all the features that exist on the corresponding
area of the earth's surface. It is essential, therefore,
that a selection be made of the classes of facts that are
to be shown, as well as of the detail that is to be used for
each class. The practical utility of the chart depends
largely on the good judgment used in this selection. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the information shown, charts differ from maps principally
in representing by soundings and curves the
configuration of the bottom of the water area, and in
showing ordinarily the topographic features only in the
vicinity of the coast line.</p>

<p>The convenience of mariners should govern in the selection
and arrangement of the information to be shown
on charts, though they may be made useful for other
purposes so long as this convenience is not lessened.
The needs and preferences of navigators alone, however,
differ so much that a reasonable chart must be
somewhat of a compromise between conflicting views.
For certain classes of navigation a boldly drawn chart
showing only the dangers and a few other soundings
and some landmarks might be useful. For other
maritime purposes a more detailed chart would be
valuable. The first, however, would fail to give facts
often demanded in the navigational use of the chart,
and the second if carried to an extreme would make a
chart difficult to use.</p>

<p>Shoals and dangers are shown either by the least
depth or by rock or reef symbols. The characteristic
soundings are shown on the chart, with abbreviations
indicating the nature of the bottom. Depth curves
are drawn, joining together points of like depth, and
inclosing areas of less depth, on the same principle
that contours are used on land maps; usually also the
shoaler spots are made more prominent by sanding
or tinting the area within them. Lighthouses, buoys,
and other artificial aids to navigation are represented,
with descriptive abbreviations. The coast is shown
by a bold solid line for high water and a dotted line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 25-29]</a></span>
for low water. The main topographic features are
represented for a moderate distance from the coast,
with such detail as is useful, depending on the scale of
the chart. Elevations are given in figures for prominent
summits, islands, and rocks; the general configuration
of hills and mountains is represented by contours
on large scale charts or by hachures or shading on
small scale charts. Rivers, streams, lakes, marshes,
towns, roads, prominent buildings, and other important
topographic features are shown by appropriate symbols.
It is important that objects which may be useful in
navigation as landmarks, whether natural or artificial,
be plainly shown and described, if necessary to their
identification, and that they should not be obscured
by details of lesser importance. On the larger scale
charts only, vegetation features, particularly areas
covered by trees, are represented by symbols. The
land area is usually clearly distinguished from the
water area by a tint or stipple. Latitude and longitude
are given by the projection lines and the subdivided
border, or sometimes on harbor plans by a note giving
the position of some one point. Brief information as
to the time and range of the tides is stated in a note.
Data regarding currents, whether due to tidal or other
causes, are given by current arrows placed on the chart,
or by explanatory notes. Compasses are for convenience
printed on the charts, and data given as to the
magnetic variation and its rate of change. On large
scale charts scales are provided for use in measuring
distances. Ranges and channel lines are given when
required. The ports are indicated where storm warning
signals are displayed. The areas of forbidden anchor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>ages
are shown, and when important, the positions of
submarine cables. The lines dividing the high seas
from inland waters are sometimes stated on United
States charts. Life saving stations are given, and time
balls are usually noted. Views of important features
are shown on some charts.</p>

<p>The layman who looks at the printed chart probably
does not appreciate the amount or the variety of
information that must be gathered and sifted and put
in proper shape for a single chart.</p>

<p><b>Need of thorough surveys.</b> As has been stated, a
good chart requires that a thorough and correct survey
be first made of the region to be charted. It is said
that men are very apt to accept as true anything they
see on a map. As to the nautical chart the mariner
is likely to be somewhat more critical, however, and
it is well that he is. The difficulty of charting an
invisible surface such as the bottom of the sea is great,
and the proportion of the navigable waters surveyed
in sufficient detail to be at all certain of the absence of
uncharted dangers is small.</p>

<p>The planning of surveys in a new region, such, for
instance, as the Philippine Islands, presents many
interesting problems, on the solution of which the
effectiveness in chart results and the cost of the work
materially depend. Many local conditions must be
taken into account. The surveys are made on opposite
coasts according to the seasonal winds and rainfall.
In some parts fair-sized steamers are necessary; in
others launches and small boats can do the work
more economically. Shore parties with land transportation
are used for portions of the work where the
country permits. Natives are employed as far as
practicable for the classes of work they can do; the
Filipinos, for instance, make good sailors on the vessels
and excellent penmen in the office.</p>

<p>The following is a brief outline of the steps of a com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>plete
survey for charting purposes, according to the present
practice of the United States Coast and Geodetic
Survey. These are given in their logical order, though
in actual work this order must often be departed from.
In this Survey the methods of control have been of a
high standard; that is, the main stations have been
accurately determined and permanently marked and
described, and this has proven an advantage in the
joining together of the original surveys and resurveys.</p>

<p><b>Astronomical observations.</b> To locate on the surface
of the earth the area to be charted, astronomical
observations are required for the latitude and longitude
of one or more points. In the best practice the longitude
of a point is obtained by observing the transits
of stars to get the local time, and sending time signals
by telegraph to obtain the difference from the local
time of some other place whose longitude is known.
The latitude is observed by measuring the difference
of zenith distance of pairs of stars crossing the meridian
north and south of the zenith. The azimuth or true
direction of some line is also obtained from star
observations, usually by observations with a theodolite
on a circumpolar star. Much existing chart work
depends on positions determined by less accurate
methods, as, for instance, longitudes obtained by transporting
chronometers between the known station and
that to be determined, or by observations of moon culminations,
and latitudes obtained by direct observations
of the altitudes of stars with theodolite or sextant.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 8. TRIANGULATION OF A BAY, SHOWING LOCATION OF SURVEY SIGNALS AND LANDMARKS.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Triangulation.</b> The main framework of the survey
consists of a series of triangles connecting prominently
located points which are permanently marked in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 33-39]</a></span>
ground and the location described so that they can be
found at a future time. At long intervals in the survey
base lines are laid out and carefully measured with steel
tape. Signals are erected over the points, including
those at the ends of the base line, and angles are then
measured at the various stations. From the measured
length of the base and the angles the lengths of the
sides of the triangles are computed, and from these
lengths and the latitude and longitude of one point the
latitudes and longitudes of all the other points are
obtained. When several astronomically determined
points are connected by such a triangulation a complication
arises from what is known as "deflection
of the plumb line," which is the angular amount by
which the actual sea-level surface of the earth departs
from the symmetrical figure of revolution, owing to the
variations in the density of the earth's outer layers.
The distance between two points as measured by triangulation
thus differs from the distance computed from
the astronomically determined positions. If this irregularity
were not taken care of by adopting mean positions,
the discrepancy in joining up different surveys would
in extreme cases amount to about half a mile.</p>

<p><b>Survey sheets</b> are next prepared, of suitable size and
scale. On each sheet a projection is laid down, that is,
the meridians and parallels are drawn, and all the points
determined in the triangulation are plotted in their true
relation. Usually separate sheets are prepared for the
topography or shore survey and for the hydrography
or survey of the water area.</p>

<p><b>Topography.</b> The topographic survey of the shore
and as much of the adjacent area as is required is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
usually made with a plane table, on which the map is
actually drawn in the field as the work progresses.
Points are located on the plane table sheet either by
direct reading of the distance on a stadia rod or by
intersections from two or more stations. On the plane
table sheet it is customary to locate the shore or high-water
line, the low-water line, off-lying rocks, streams,
rivers, roads, towns, lighthouses, and all prominent
features near the coast. Elevations are measured with
the plane table or obtained from the triangulation, and
are represented on the sheet both by figures and by
contours, which are lines joining together points of
the same elevation. For instance, a 100-foot contour
represents the line where a plane 100 feet above sea
level would cut the surface of the ground. It is particularly
important in this topographic work to locate
accurately objects which are good landmarks and likely
to be of use to the mariner. In some regions auxiliary
methods are used in filling in the topography, as, for
instance, along a difficult coast each feature of importance
may be located by sextant angles, or a traverse line
may be run along the shore by the transit and stadia
method.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The hydrography,</b> or the survey of the water area, is
of prime importance for the chart, but in the order of
prosecution of the work it is convenient but not essential
that it come after sufficient points have been located
by the triangulation and topography. A hydrographic
sheet is prepared on which all the points are plotted
which will be useful. A system of sounding lines is
then run over the entire area to be surveyed, locating the
position of the sounding boat at intervals by sextant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 41-49]</a></span>
angles on survey signals or by angles from the shore.
The ordinary method of sounding is to cast a lead from
a boat and read the depth when the lead touches bottom
and the line is vertical, and make note of the nature of
the bottom. There is a systematic spacing between the
casts of the lead and between the lines passed over by
the boat, depending on the depth of water and character
of the bottom. For soundings in deeper water various
forms of sounding machines are used, with weight
attached to a wire. For very great depths a small steel
wire is employed and the weight is detached and left
on the bottom. The deepest sounding thus far made,
5269 fathoms, or nearly six miles, was obtained by this
method in the Pacific Ocean near Guam.</p>

</div>

<p>The offshore soundings are made from a surveying
steamer; the inshore work is usually done by a launch
or small boat.</p>

<p>So far as the navigational use of charts is concerned it
is important that the hydrography shall show the limiting
depths and the freedom from dangers, of channels,
entrances, harbors, and anchorages. It is also desirable
that the soundings shall be carried off shore at least as
far as the one-hundred-fathom curve, as with the modern
forms of navigational sounding machines it is possible
for vessels under way to obtain soundings to this depth,
and such soundings may be of value in identifying the
location of the vessel. For depths greater than one
hundred fathoms the soundings have less direct value
to navigation except as proving the absence of shoaler
areas, but soundings throughout the oceanic regions are
of great geographical interest as well as of direct practical
value in the laying of cables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>It is obvious that the plan of mapping the sea bottom
by dropping a lead at intervals over its hidden surface
is far from an ideal one. The lead gives the depth
only at the point at which it touches the bottom, and
no information as to the space between the casts except
such as may be inferred from the relation of successive
soundings. In numerous cases, after what was considered
a very thorough survey of a region had been
made, at some later day a pinnacle rock or other danger
has been discovered. For instance, a very detailed
hydrographic survey of Buzzards Bay was made in
1895; the sounding lines were run at intervals of 50
to 100 yards, and 91,000 soundings were made for a
single sheet. Within this area the cruiser <i>Brooklyn</i>
in 1902 touched a rock which was found to have 18
feet over it. (<a href="#Fig17">Fig. 17.</a>) The least depth in the vicinity
developed in the original survey was 31 feet.</p>

<p>For the satisfactory development of hydrographic
work some invention is much needed which as it
passes along the bottom will give a continuous depth
curve. Several devices have successfully accomplished
this in shoal water, but great credit awaits the inventor
who designs something of more general application.</p>

<p><b>Tides and currents.</b> Information must be obtained
as to the movement of the water, both vertical and
horizontal. The rise and fall of the tide are obtained
by tide gauges, either automatic, which draw a continuous
tidal curve on a roll of paper, or simple tide
staffs, which must be read at intervals. The currents,
whether due to the tides or other movements, are
measured by noting the movement of partially sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 51-55]</a></span>merged
floats. Less accurate but useful information
as to currents is obtained from the logs of vessels.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 18. DRAGGING FOR DANGERS WITH A LONG WIRE.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Dragging for dangers</b> has long been resorted to for
the investigation of isolated spots. A valuable and
successful means has been employed recently of making
sure that an area is free from shoals or rocks
having less than a certain depth. This is done by
dragging through the water a wire from 500 to 1400
feet long, and suspended at the required depth, with
suitable buoys and weights, and kept taut by the angle
of pull. If, for instance, the wire is set at a depth of
30 feet it will indicate the presence of any obstruction
of less depth by catching on it and upsetting the buoys,
and such spots are at once marked and investigated.
Considerable work has been done with such drags in
the last few years on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts
and on the Great Lakes. This is of course a somewhat
tedious process and gives no information as to depths
greater than that for which the wire is set, but the
experience already had indicates its great value. It
will probably be found desirable in time to thus drag all
water areas important to navigation where the depth
is near the draft of vessels and the irregular nature of
the bottom gives indication of dangers. In extensive
dragging operations near Key West and in Jericho Bay,
Maine, a number of shoals have been picked up which
were not found in the original surveys.</p>

<p>A remarkable instance of the value of the drag was
the recent discovery of a rock in Blue Hill Bay on the
coast of Maine. This rock has but 7 feet of water
over it, and is only 6 feet in diameter at the top. It is
surrounded by depths of 78 feet, from which it rises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
nearly perpendicularly. The original survey gave no
indication of a danger here, and its existence was not
suspected until it was discovered with the wire drag.</p>

<p>Another method of dragging that has been employed
is by means of a pipe suspended beneath a ship's
bottom.</p>

<p><b>Magnetic variation.</b> As the compass is a universal
navigational instrument, information as to the magnetic
variation is needed for the charts. The angle between
the direction of the magnetic needle and the true north
is measured at various points on both land and sea,
and at some stations these observations are repeated
after a number of years. From these results magnetic
maps are made, from which both the variation and
its annual change may be taken.</p>

<p><b>Reports of dangers.</b> Aside from the more systematic
surveys as outlined above, much information has
been placed on the charts from other sources. On
the earlier charts and on those of more remote regions
at the present day much of the work has been sketched
rather than surveyed. Even in the better surveyed
portions reports come in as to dangers or other matters
not shown, and if of importance and the report appears
to be reliable these are sometimes at once put on the
chart pending further investigation, or in other cases
an examination is first made.</p>

<p>Shoals, rocks, and even islands have in numerous
instances been shown on the charts which no one has
been able to find again, and many of them after
repeated searches have been removed. The same
island or danger has sometimes been charted in two
or more different positions as reported at various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
times. The treatment of such cases is one of the
serious and interesting problems of the chart maker.
It is generally less harmful to show a danger which
does not exist than to omit one which does exist. On
the other hand a non-existing danger shown on a chart
may be the cause of actual expense and loss of time
in compelling a vessel needlessly to go out of its
course.</p>

<p>It is surprising to note with what lack of care and of
sufficient evidence reports of dangers at sea have sometimes
been made, and how incomplete are many of the
reports even when the existence of the danger is beyond
question. It is unfortunately true that some of these
reports are the result of effort to escape blame for accident
by throwing the fault on the chart. Many such
reports also result from various illusory appearances.
A large tree covered with weeds, an overturned iceberg
strewn with earth and stones, a floating ice-pan covered
with earth, the swollen carcass of a dead whale, a whale
with clinging barnacles and seaweed, reflections from
the clouds, marine animalculæ, vegetable growth, scum,
floating volcanic matter, and partially submerged wrecks
covered with barnacles, have been mistaken for islands,
shoals, or reefs. A school of jumping fish has given the
appearance of breakers or caused a sound like surf, and
tide rips have been mistaken for breakers. Raper very
properly calls attention to the obligation upon every
seaman of carefully investigating doubtful cases and
making reliable reports. "Of the dangers to which
navigation is exposed none is more formidable than a
reef or a shoal in the open sea; not only from the almost
certain fate of the ship and her crew that have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
misfortune to strike upon it, but also from the anxiety
with which the navigation of all vessels, within even a
long distance, must be conducted, on account of the
uncertainty to which their own reckonings are ever open.
No commander of a vessel, therefore, who might meet
unexpectedly with any such danger, could be excused,
except by urgent circumstances, from taking the necessary
steps both for ascertaining its true position, and for
giving a description as complete as a prudent regard to
his own safety allowed."</p>

<p>As to the older doubtful dangers now shown on the
oceanic charts, it is estimated that the positions may be
considered as uncertain by 10 miles in latitude and
30 miles in longitude, and areas of this extent must be
searched to determine definitely the question of their
existence.</p>

<p>The following are interesting or typical cases of
reported dangers:</p>

<p>The master of an Italian bark in September, 1874,
reported sighting a large rock in latitude 40° N. and
longitude 62° 18´ W. Fortunately for the charts there
were two independent reports from other vessels in the
same month of sighting a partially submerged wreck
in this vicinity.</p>

<p>The Spanish steamer <i>Carmen</i> was wrecked in 1891
by running on a rock off the southwest coast of Leyte;
the rock was reported to lie one mile off shore, a dangerous
position for vessels using Canigao Channel. A
survey made in 1903 showed 58 feet of water in this
location, and that Carmen Rock on which the vessel
struck was really within one-fourth mile of the beach.
The rock had, however, for twelve years been shown on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
the charts in a position which made it an obstruction
to navigation.</p>

<p>The ship <i>Minerva</i> in 1834 was reported to have
struck a rock near the middle of the broad entrance to
Balayan Bay; the fact that this occurred at 2 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>
indicated a very doubtful position, but it was stated
that an American ship had previously been wrecked on
the same rock. It consequently appeared as a danger
on the charts for seventy-one years, when a survey
showed no depth of less than 190 fathoms in this vicinity,
and it was removed from the charts.</p>

<p>A British steamer was wrecked in San Bernardino
Strait in 1905; the master reported that he was in a
position where the chart showed 51 fathoms, and that
he was 1<span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>2</span></span> miles distant from Calantas Rock, and on
these grounds the finding of the official inquiry was that
"no blame can be attached to the master, officers, or any
of the crew for the casualty." Very shortly after the
disaster, the surveying steamer <i>Pathfinder</i> definitely
located the wreck and made a survey of the vicinity.
The previous chart of Calantas Reef was found to be
fairly correct, and the stranding was determined to have
occurred well within this reef in a position where the
chart showed soundings of 3<span class="fraction"><span>3</span><span>4</span></span> to 4<span class="fraction"><span>3</span><span>4</span></span> fathoms, and
<span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>2</span></span> mile from Calantas Rock, which rises 5 feet above
high water.</p>

<p>A transport entering San Bernardino Strait a few
years ago ran on a rock and was damaged; the position
was reported as about two miles southeast of San
Bernardino Island and near the middle of the passage.
The rock was not put on the charts, as prompt investigation
showed 50 fathoms of water in this vicinity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
that in all probability the transport actually touched a
small reef making out from the island.</p>

<p>The master of the brig <i>Helen</i> reported that his vessel
was wrecked on a reef lying six miles from Rockall.
When surveyed Helen Reef was found to be about
one-third this distance from Rockall.</p>

<p>An island has been reported in eight different positions,
ranging in latitude from 30° 29´ to 30° 42´ N.
and in longitude from 139° 37´ to 140° 38´ E.</p>

<p>There have been a number of reports of islands
in the area from latitude 40° 00´ to 40° 30´ N. and longitude
150° 30´ to 151° 00´ W. The master of the bark
<i>Washington</i> reported in 1867: "On my passage
from the Sandwich Islands to the northwest coast
of the United States, when in latitude 40° 00´ N., in a
dense fog, I perceived the sea to be discolored. Soundings
at first gave great depths, but diminished gradually
to 9 fathoms, when through the mist an island was
seen, along which I sailed 40 miles. It was covered
with birds, and the sea swarmed with seal and sea
elephants." A United States vessel searched in this
vicinity without seeing any indication of land, and
obtained soundings of 2600 fathoms. A British ship
in 1858 searched for fourteen days over this area without
finding anything. Searches were also made in 1860
and 1867 without success, and the present charts
show no islands in this part of the Pacific.</p>

<p>In a number of cases erroneous positions have been
due simply to blunders. Thus Lots Wife, first seen
by Captain Meares in 1788, was shown on his chart in
latitude 29° 50´ N., longitude 156° 00´ E., and stated
in his book to be in latitude 29° 50´ N. and longitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
142° 23´ E. Massachusetts Island by one report was
in longitude 177° 05´ E. and by another in 167° 05´ E.
The apparent blunder of 10° is now immaterial, as the
island has disappeared from the charts altogether.
The Knox Islands were placed by the Wilkes Exploring
Expedition in latitude 5° 59´ 15´´ N., longitude 172° 02´
33´´ E. The old British charts showed islands of this
name also in latitude 5° 59´ N., longitude 172° 03´ W.,
the longitude being doubtless transposed. In the case
of Starbuck Island, discovered south of the equator, the
latitude was apparently transposed, as on old charts
it was also shown in the position, latitude 5° 40´ N.,
longitude 156° 55´ W.</p>

<p>A pinnacle rock can sometimes be located only with
great difficulty even when known to exist. Rodger
Rock, on which the bark <i>Ellen</i> struck and was
damaged, lies in latitude 0° 41´ 15´´ N. and longitude
107° 31´ E. It has but three feet over it at low tide. The
British surveying ship <i>Rifleman</i> searched four days
before finding it, although the plotted tracks showed
that she and her boats had passed very close to it.
This indicates that great caution must be used in
removing a reported danger from the charts.</p>

<p>The old charts of the Atlantic indicated a danger
30 to 45 miles to the southwest of Cape St. Vincent.
This danger was omitted from the charts about 1786
owing to lack of confirmation. Later, in 1813 and 1821,
it was reported that vessels were lost or damaged by
striking this rock. Soundings of over a thousand
fathoms are now shown on the chart in this vicinity
and the rock no longer appears.</p>

<p>A comparison of a Pacific Ocean chart of about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
forty years ago with one of the present time (<a href="#Fig19">Fig. 19</a>)
illustrates in a striking manner how many doubtful
dangers, or vigias, have gotten on the charts and how
after laborious search many of them have now been
removed. This condition was especially true of the
Pacific, owing to the numerous reports of an indefinite
nature from whaling ships, among whose captains
there was a saying "that they do not care where their
ship is, so long as there are plenty of whales in sight."</p>

<h2><a name="PREPARATION_OF_INFORMATION_FOR_CHARTS" id="PREPARATION_OF_INFORMATION_FOR_CHARTS">PREPARATION OF INFORMATION FOR CHARTS.</a></h2>


<p><b>Chart schemes.</b> Before commencing the preparation
of a chart it is necessary to arrange a definite scheme
for it, and the usefulness of the chart will depend
materially on this preliminary plan, in which must
be outlined its scale, size, limits, and features to be
represented. New charts have sometimes been prepared
simply to fit the surveys as they progressed or
to fill immediate or local requirements. It is, however,
desirable that general plans for series or groups of
charts be made, and with changing needs, information,
and conditions it is sometimes necessary that existing
schemes be modified.</p>

<p><b>Compilation of information.</b> Considerable work must
usually be done to get the field records in shape for
the published chart. The soundings must be plotted
and the characteristic depths selected. Only a part of
the soundings that are made can be shown on the
original sheet and only a small part of these are used on
the final chart. A selection is made showing the least
soundings on shoals and bars, the channel depths, and
the characteristic soundings in anchorages and other
areas. The original surveys are generally made on a
considerably larger scale than that on which the chart
is published, in order that the soundings may be more
thoroughly plotted. The sheets must then be reduced
to the scale of publication, and this can conveniently be
done by means of photography or with a pantograph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>The best judgment is required in selecting the
important features to be shown on the chart and
omitting the less important and not essential features
which might tend to obscure the others. In charts of
new regions where complete surveys are lacking, care
must be exercised in weighing, combining, and adjusting
information from various sources and which is,
perhaps, more or less conflicting.</p>

<p><b>Projections.</b> The surface of the earth being curved,
there is no possible system of projection by which it can
be represented on a flat sheet of paper in an ideally
satisfactory way. Numerous methods of projecting the
earth's surface upon a plane have been proposed and
many of them are actually used for various purposes.
In general each projection has qualities which are
valuable for certain uses, and deficiencies which make
it less valuable in other ways. Only four of the different
projections need be mentioned here as of special
interest in chart construction.</p>

<p><b>Mercator projection.</b> This is a rectangular projection
in which the meridians are straight lines spaced at equal
intervals and the parallels are straight lines so spaced
as to satisfy the condition that a rhumb line, or line on
the earth cutting successive meridians at the same angle,
shall appear on the developed projection as a straight
line preserving the same angle with respect to the
meridians.</p>

<p>This projection may be considered as the unrolling
upon a plane of the surface of a cylinder tangent to the
earth along the equator, and upon which the various
features of the earth's surface have been projected in
such manner as to satisfy the above requirement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>On this projection there is a constant distance between
the meridians, whereas on the earth they
actually converge toward the poles. The distance
between the parallels increases in passing toward the
poles, approximately in the proportion of the secant
of the latitude. For each small portion of the map
the relative proportions are maintained as on the
earth.</p>

<p>Some characteristics of the mercator projection are
these: The meridians and parallels are all straight lines
and perpendicular to each other; there is no convergence
of the meridians; the minute of longitude is a constant
distance on the map; the minute of latitude increases in
length from the equator toward the poles but locally
retains its true proportion to the minute of longitude;
areas and distances increase in scale with the latitude
so that a given scale is strictly correct only for one
latitude; great circles and consequently lines of sight
are curved lines excepting the meridians and the equator;
rhumb lines or lines having a constant angle with the
meridians are straight, and for the same angle are
parallel in all parts of the chart. These qualities are
all rigid and the projection can therefore be used for all
areas, small or large, up to the extent of the earth's
surface, except that it cannot be extended to the poles,
as there the length of the minute of latitude would
become infinite.</p>

<p>An interesting fact regarding a rhumb line oblique
to the meridians is that it is a spiral continually
approaching but never reaching the pole; this spiral
makes an infinite number of revolutions around the
pole, and yet it has a finite length for the reason that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the length of each revolution diminishes as the number
of revolutions increases.</p>

CIRCLE ROUTES YOKOHAMA TO PUGET SOUND, AND YOKOHAMA TO HONOLULU
AND THENCE TO SAN FRANCISCO.</p>
</div>

<p>The mercator projection has been extensively used
for nautical charts, for which it presents important
mechanical advantages, in that adjacent charts can be
joined on all their edges while still oriented with the
meridian; all charts are similar; the border may be
conveniently subdivided, giving a longitude scale applicable
to any part of the chart, but a latitude scale that
may be used in the same latitude only; courses are
laid down as straight lines and can be transferred with
parallel rulers from one part of the chart to another
without error. On a mercator chart an island in
latitude 60° would appear four times as large as an
island of the same actual area at the equator, but
this distortion of areas, while it gives erroneous impressions
on charts of great extent in latitude, does not seriously
affect the use of the chart for nautical purposes.
Areas may also be correctly measured on a mercator
map by taking each projection quadrilateral separately,
subdividing it if necessary, and using the published
tables of areas of quadrilaterals in different latitudes.
Although distance scales vary with the latitude, distances
can be taken from this chart with fair correctness
by the use of the latitude border scale for the middle
latitude, subdividing the total distance if there is much
range of latitude. The inability to take off the great
circle or shortest course directly from the mercator
chart is from a navigational point of view a defect,
but the most convenient solution for this appears to
be the supplementary use of a gnomonic chart as will
be described. The fact that lines of sight are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 71-73]</a></span>
straight lines on this projection is another defect, as
by the plotting of bearings and angles on approaching
the land the positions of vessels are located on the
chart; fortunately, however, the error due to this cause
usually falls within the other uncertainties involved in
locating a ship; if need be it would be practicable to
allow for this curvature. In the polar regions, however,
the faults of the mercator projection become so
much exaggerated that it is not used for navigational
purposes, but because of the absence of commercial
navigation there this is a minor matter in the general
question of chart projection. For the plotting of original
surveys the mercator projection is not suited and is
not used, for the reasons above mentioned.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 23. POLYCONIC PROJECTION OF PORTION OF NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN.</p>
</div>

<p>Tables of "meridional parts" are published which
give the distance in terms of minutes of longitude from
the equator to the various parallels; with these tables
a mercator projection may readily be constructed.</p>

<p>Airy proposed a graphical method of sweeping the
arc of a great circle on to a mercator chart, and tables
are published for this purpose. The method is only
approximate and is limited in application, and the
supplementary use of a gnomonic chart would appear
to be preferable.</p>

<p><b>Polyconic projection.</b> In plotting the original surveys
it is essential that a projection be used which will for the
area included on a survey sheet show the points in their
correct relation both as to direction and distance.
These conditions are substantially fulfilled by several
projections, of which the polyconic is used in the
United States. If a hollow cone were placed so that
it would either be tangent to the earth's surface along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
one of the parallels of latitude or cut it along two
parallels, and the points projected on to this cone, and
the cone then unrolled and laid out flat, the result
would be a conical projection, of which there are several
variations. If successive tangent cones be used and
each parallel of latitude be developed as the circumference
of the base of a right cone tangent to the spheroid
along that parallel, the result is the polyconic projection,
which has been used for field sheets and for the large
scale charts, as well as for the topographic maps of the
United States. This projection has valuable qualities
for moderate areas of the earth's surface, within which
the scale is approximately uniform, areas retain nearly
their true proportions, and great circles and consequently
all bearings and directions are approximately
straight lines. The parallels of latitude are arcs of
circles with radiuses increasing as we recede from the
pole; therefore they are not truly parallel and the length
of the degree of latitude increases either side from the
central meridian. The meridians converge toward the
poles and become slightly curved as we recede from
the central one; the longitude scale is everywhere correct,
but the latitude scale is strictly correct only on the
central meridian. The angles of intersection of parallels
and meridians are right angles or nearly so. The
polyconic projection is not used for very extensive areas
of the earth's surface, as for instance a hemisphere.</p>

ROUTES YOKOHAMA TO PUGET SOUND, AND YOKOHAMA TO HONOLULU AND

</div>

<p><b>Gnomonic projection.</b> In this projection the eye is
assumed to be at the center of the earth and the features
are projected upon a plane tangent to some point on
the earth's surface. It is practicable to use this projection
for oceanic areas, and it has the very important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 75-79]</a></span>
quality that every straight line on it represents a great
circle of the earth. To obtain the great circle or
shortest course between two points it is therefore only
necessary to draw a straight line between the points
on a gnomonic chart. Because of the great distortion
near the edges this projection is not otherwise adapted
to navigational use, and it is employed only to mark
out the general course, and sufficient points are then
transferred to a mercator chart. The gnomonic chart
is therefore useful in supplementing the mercator chart,
supplying its deficiencies as to convenience in marking
out great circle courses. The great circle course can
be derived not only more easily and quickly from the
gnomonic chart than by computation, but the chart is
also to be preferred because the course marked out on
it will show at once if any obstruction, as an island or
danger, is met or too high a latitude is reached. A
modified or composite course can readily be laid out
on a gnomonic chart.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 25. NORTH POLAR CHART ON ARBITRARY PROJECTION.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Arbitrary projection.</b> The few charts published of
the polar regions are sometimes on an arbitrary projection,
in which the meridians are straight lines radiating
from the pole and the parallels are equidistant
circles with the pole as center. The latitude scale is
uniform. At some distance from the pole the longitude
scale becomes very much distorted, but the projection
is a practicable and convenient one for the immediate
polar regions. Gnomonic and conical projections are
also used for the polar charts, differing little from the
foregoing for moderate areas.</p>

<p><b>Scales.</b> Charts are published on a variety of scales
to suit different needs of navigation, and the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
classification depends on scale. In addition to the
ocean charts covering a single ocean in either one or
several sheets and intended for navigation on the high
seas, there are for our Atlantic coast the following series:</p>

<p>Sailing charts, scale about <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>1200000</span></span>, for general coastwise
navigation.</p>

<p>General coast charts, scale <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>400000</span></span>, for local coastwise
navigation.</p>

<p>Coast charts, scale <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>80000</span></span>, for approaching the coast
at any point and for inside passages.</p>

<p>Harbor and channel charts, of various large scales
from <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>5000</span></span> to <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>60000</span></span>, for entering harbors and rivers and
passing through channels.</p>

<p>The expression of scales by miles to the inch or inches
to the mile is the more familiar. The expression of
scale in the manner used by the Coast Survey and by
most of the European countries, by standard fractions
as <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>80000</span></span>, meaning that any distance on the chart is
<span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>80000</span></span> of the actual distance on the earth, has some
advantages. For instance, the relation of these fractions
gives at a glance the relation of the scales of the
charts. Thus a <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>80000</span></span> chart is on a scale five times as
large as a <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>400000</span></span> chart.</p>

<p>For the more important harbors charts have been
published on several different scales to meet various
needs. Thus New York Harbor is shown on charts of
scales of <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>10000</span></span>, <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>40000</span></span>, <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>80000</span></span>, <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>200000</span></span>, <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>400000</span></span> and
<span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>1200000</span></span>, each of course including a different area.</p>

</div>

<p>The selection of suitable publication scales is of
prime importance; a large scale permits of greater
clearness and of showing more detail, but on the other
hand restricts the area and the points that can be shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 81-83]</a></span>
on a single sheet, or else makes a chart of excessive
dimensions. In general in chart preparation the scale
should be restricted to the minimum that can be used
to fulfill the particular object and clearly represent
what is desired. A chart of very large scale is not
convenient for plotting, and a moving vessel may pass
quickly beyond it or into range of objects beyond the
limits of the chart.</p>

<p><b>Methods of publication.</b> An ideal process of publication
for nautical charts would include the following
features; rapidity in getting out new charts, facility
in reprinting and correcting existing charts, clearness
and sharpness of print, durability of paper and print,
and correctness of scale. It is difficult to fulfill all these
requirements by any method as yet developed. In the
Coast and Geodetic Survey several different processes
are in use at present; charts are engraved on copper
and printed directly from the copper plate, or they are
transferred from the copper plate to stone and printed
from the stone, or a finished drawing is made and
transferred to stone by photolithography and printed
from the stone, or an etching is made on copper from a
finished drawing and printed from a transfer to stone.
Charts in other countries are in large part printed from
engraved plates, excepting some preliminary charts by
lithography.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 28. ENGRAVING SOUNDINGS ON A COPPER PLATE WITH A MACHINE.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Copper plate engraving and printing</b> have long been
used in chart preparation. A drawing is prepared as
a guide for the engraver; this must be correct as to all
information to be shown but need not be a finished
drawing. A true projection is ruled upon a copper
plate. By photography a matrix is made from the
drawing and a wax impression taken from this matrix.
This is then laid down on the copper to fit the projection,
and the impression is chemically fixed on to the copper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 85-89]</a></span>
The work thus marked out is engraved by hand or by
machine. A high degree of skill is required in the
accuracy and finish necessary for chart engraving.
Machines have been invented in recent years which can
be used for portions of the work on copper plates, as
for instance for cutting the sounding figures, the
bottom characteristics, the border and projection lines,
border divisions, compasses, line ruling, and stipple
ruling. Stamps and dies have been successfully used
for some symbols and notes, and roulettes for shading.
By means of these various machines, many of which are
American inventions, the process of chart publication
from plates has been materially facilitated.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 29. ELECTROTYPING PLANT FOR ELECTROTYPING CHART PLATES.</p>
</div>

<p>When the plate is completed an alto, or raised copy,
is made by depositing copper on to it in an electrotype
vat, and from this alto another basso or sunken copy is
made by the same process. This latter basso is used
in printing. A copper plate may be used for about
3000 impressions, after which it may become too much
worn for satisfactory chart printing. By printing from
a duplicate basso the original plate is preserved and
additional copies can be made when needed. The
use of the alto also greatly facilitates matters when a
considerable correction to the chart is required. All
the portions of the chart to be changed can be scraped
off the alto, and when a new basso is electrotyped from
this scraped alto all such areas will of course appear
as smooth copper, on which the new work can be
engraved. Numerous small corrections are called for
on charts, and on copper plates where these are to
replace old work the latter is removed either by hammering
up the back of the plate or by scraping its face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>Printing directly from plates is a laborious process.
After the press bed has been carefully padded to take
up inequalities in the plate, the surface of the latter
is covered with ink and then carefully wiped off by
hand, leaving the ink only in the engraved lines. The
paper, first dampened, is laid on the plate, and passes
with it beneath the cylinder of the press under considerable
pressure. The prints are calendered by being
placed in a hydraulic press under 600 tons pressure.
The charts are beautifully clear and sharp, not equalled
by other methods of printing. Owing to the wetting
and drying of the paper, the finished print is, however,
quite appreciably smaller in scale than the plate, and
the shrinkage is greater in one direction than in the
other. The average day's work for one press and two
men is 75 prints. This is small compared with the
output practicable with lithographic presses. On the
other hand a plate can be prepared for printing more
readily than a lithographic stone. For small editions
the plate printing compares well in economy with
lithographic printing, and the plate can also be printed
on short notice. Because of changes in aids to navigation
and other corrections, it is usually desirable to
print at one time only a sufficient number of copies
of a chart to meet current demands, and not to carry
a large stock on hand.</p>

<p>The copper plates, bassos, and altos make a very
convenient and enduring means of preserving the
chart ready for printing or for further correction. A
large number of plates can be placed in a small space,
and if properly cared for they may be stored indefinitely
without deterioration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 91-93]</a></span></p>

<p>With plate printing it is not practicable to print
more than one impression on the chart or to use more
than one color, and plate-printed charts are therefore
in black only.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 31. LITHOGRAPHING PRESSES FOR PRINTING CHARTS; LITHOGRAPH STONE
ON TRANSFER PRESS.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Engraving on stone.</b> On the United States Lake
Survey the charts are first engraved on stone, and by
a special process the work is then transferred to small
copper plates, which are preserved. The final publication
is by lithography, transferring again from the
plates to stone.</p>

<p><b>Photolithography</b> is a quick method of publishing
a chart. It would be practicable by this means to
reproduce the original survey sheets, but ordinarily
these are not suitable as to scale and legibility, and
it is necessary to make a new drawing, usually on
tracing vellum. This is photographed on to glass
plates, on the scale of the proposed chart. From these
glass negatives positive prints are made on sensitized
lithographic paper. These prints are fitted together
and then inked, taking the ink only where the lines
appear. This transfer print is then laid face down
on the lithographic stone and run through a press
under pressure, the stone absorbing the ink from the
paper. The stone is then treated so that the inked
portion remains slightly raised, and from this stone an
indefinite number of charts can be printed in a lithographic
press at the rate of 1000 an hour. The paper
is not moistened, and consequently there is little distortion
or change of scale in prints from stone. If desired
to shade the land or use another color for any other
purpose, additional impressions can be made on the
same charts from other stones. Because of the bulk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
of the stones, work cannot ordinarily be retained on
them, but the chart is cleaned off and the stones
repeatedly used until worn thin. The original drawing
as well as the negatives is preserved, from which the
chart can again be published. For republication, the
process is, however, not entirely satisfactory; the
negatives are not always permanent, the work must
again be assembled and transferred to the stone,
changes or corrections are not very conveniently made
on either drawing or negative, and after repeated
changes the drawing becomes difficult to use in
photolithography. Whether the charts are actually
printed from copper or stone, there are decided advantages
therefore in the matter of correction work and
future editions in having the charts engraved on copper.
On the other hand, the advantages of the photolithographic
process are the ability to publish new drawings
promptly, to use more than one shade on a chart, to
obtain prints with little change of scale or distortion,
and to print large editions rapidly.</p>

<p><b>Lithographic printing by transfer from engraved
plates.</b> An impression on transfer paper may be taken
from an engraved plate and this laid down on the stone
in a manner similar to that used in laying down the
prints from the glass negatives in photolithography.
Prints are then made from the stone the same as
in photolithography, but with superior results as to
clearness. This general process is extensively used
in both map and chart publishing in this country, as
it combines the advantages of the plate in preservation
of the chart record and facility of correction, and the
advantages of the lithographic printing in less distortion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
of the printed chart, ability to print more than one shade,
and facility for large editions. As the transfer from
the plate can be readily made it is also better applicable
to small editions than is photolithography. It is, however,
not as convenient in the latter respect as plate
printing, and it does not give a resulting impression
equal in clearness or durability to the impression directly
from the plate.</p>

<p><b>Etching on copper</b> for chart publication has been
recently developed in the Coast and Geodetic Survey.
A finished tracing is made, the surface of a smooth copper
plate is sensitized, and by exposure to the sun a
print is made on the sensitized surface. It is essential
to use an air-exhausted printing frame so as to get
good contact between the vellum and the plate. The
work is then etched into the copper and the plate
cleaned and touched up, after which it may be used the
same as a hand-engraved plate, either for transfer to
stone or direct plate printing. The expense and time
required in the etching process are much less than for
hand engraving. The process has been successfully used
for a number of harbor charts. The etching of course
will be of the same scale as the vellum at the time of
the print, and vellum varies somewhat in scale with
weather conditions and age. Unless overcome by the
substitution of some more invariable material in place
of vellum, this might be an obstacle to the use of the
process for general charts where a true scale on the
copper plate is desirable because of future work to be
done on the plate. It must also be taken into account
that the etching requires a finished tracing in ink, which
is not essential for the hand engraver; if, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the chart is first published by photolithography, as is the
usual practice in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the
same tracing is used for both processes.</p>

<p><b>Distribution of charts.</b> Charts published by the
government are sold to the public at a small price,
estimated to cover the cost of paper and printing. The
charts may be obtained direct from the publishing
office or from the chart agents who are to be found in
all the principal seaports. Catalogues are published
from time to time giving complete lists of the current
charts and the main facts regarding them. Index maps
show graphically the area covered by each chart. The
notices to mariners contain announcement of new charts
or new editions published and of charts or editions
cancelled, as well as of all corrections.</p>

<p><b>Need for revision.</b> The making of the survey and the
printing of the chart do not complete the problem of the
chart maker. Both nature and man are constantly
changing the facts the representation of which has been
attempted on the charts, and also the needs of man are
always varying. The original surveys are made to
meet the reasonable requirements of the time, but
breakwaters and jetties are built, and channels and
harbors dredged and otherwise improved, and cities
built, and new paths of commerce are opened which
bring vessels into waters previously thought of minor
importance.</p>

<p>With the increase of commerce and speed of vessels
more direct routes are demanded for reasons of economy.
Inside routes not originally used are sometimes
developed for defensive reasons. The average draft of
the larger vessels has also increased remarkably since
the modern hydrographic surveys were commenced,
and surveys once made to insure safety for the deepest
vessels of that time are now not adequate. The average
loaded draft of the 20 largest steamships of the world
has increased as follows: 1848, 19 feet; 1873, 24 feet;
1898, 29 feet; 1903, 32 feet. The average length of
these vessels was 230 feet in 1848, 390 feet in 1873,
541 feet in 1898, and 640 feet in 1903. The number of
vessels drawing as much as 26<span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>4</span></span> feet rose from 36 in
1902 to 185 in 1904. In 1906 there were 17 vessels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
afloat, drawing 32 feet and upwards. There are now
two steamers on the Atlantic 790 feet long, 88 feet beam,
and 37<span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>2</span></span> feet draft when fully loaded, and larger vessels
are already planned.</p>

<p>Great natural agencies are also constantly at work
effecting changes in features shown on the charts.
The action of currents and waves is continually cutting
away or building the shore, particularly on sandy
coasts exposed to storms. When surveyed in 1849
Fishing Point on the east coast of Maryland was but
a bend in the shore line. By 1887 it had built out
about two miles in a southerly direction, and in 1902
about two-thirds of a mile further, curving to the westward.
Altogether in about half a century this tongue
of land has grown out nearly three miles.</p>

<p>Rivers are bearing vast quantities of sediment and
depositing these near their mouths, pushing out the
coast line and filling in the bottom. The main mouths
of the Mississippi are advancing into the Gulf, but at
a comparatively slow rate. A break from the main
river at Cubit's Gap just above the head of the passes,
however, has done an enormous amount of land
making, filling in an area of about 50 square miles
between 1852 and 1905.</p>

FIG. 37. BOGOSLOF VOLCANO, BERING SEA.</p>
</div>

<p>Volcanic action in well authenticated cases has
caused islands to rise or disappear. In the present
location of Bogoslof Island in Bering Sea the early
voyagers described a "sail rock." In this position in
1796 there arose a high island. In 1883 another island
appeared near it. In 1906 a high cone arose between
the two, and a continuous island was formed over
1<span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>2</span></span> miles long and 500 feet high. The latest report
(September, 1907) was that this central peak had suddenly
collapsed and disappeared. Bogoslof is an active
volcano, and the main changes have been the result
of violent volcanic action. The history of this island
for over a century past forms a remarkable record of
violent transformations in the sea.</p>

<p>Earthquakes sometimes cause sudden displacements,
horizontal or vertical, of sufficient amount to affect the
information shown on the charts. A careful investigation
of the effects of the earthquake in Yakutat Bay,
Alaska, in September, 1899, showed that the shore
was raised in some parts with a maximum uplift
of 47 feet and depressed in other parts, and that at
least two reefs and four islets were raised in the water
area where none appeared before. Undoubtedly there
were changes in the water depths, but definite information
is lacking because there had been no previous
hydrographic survey. The San Francisco earthquake
of 1906 caused little vertical displacement, but there
were horizontal changes of relative position as much
as 16 feet; so far as known this earthquake did not
affect the practical accuracy of the charts. Related<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
to earthquake phenomena are the gradual coast movements
of elevation or subsidence which are taking
place but at so slow a rate as not to sensibly affect the
charts in ordinary intervals of time.</p>

<p>Another agency at work is the coral polyp on the
coral reefs; although the rate of growth appears to be
very slow, the resulting reefs and keys are an important
feature in tropical seas.</p>

<p>Practically all of the land features shown on charts
are likewise subject to changes, the more rapid of
which are mainly due to the works of man.</p>

<p>The changes of channels and of commercial needs
cause many alterations to be made from time to time
in the lights and buoys which are shown on the charts.</p>

<p><b>Methods of correction.</b> The problem of keeping a
chart sufficiently up to date is one of much practical
importance and one which must be taken into account
in planning what should be shown on the chart in the
first place so as to bring it within the range of practicable
revision.</p>

<p>Certain features are corrected at once on the charts
as soon as the information is received, such as dangers
reported, and changes in lights and buoys. Where
harbor works are in progress the periodic surveys made
in this country by the Corps of Engineers furnish data
which are applied promptly to the charts. Reported
dangers in channels and bars are investigated by special
surveys and the information is put on the charts.
Examinations are made from time to time for the
revision of the features along the coast line. Complete
resurveys have been made, at long intervals, of some
important portions of the coast where there has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
evidence of change, and these, when they become
available, are applied to the charts. All parts of the
coast where the exposed portions are not of very
permanent material will require resurveys at intervals,
depending on their importance and the rate of change.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the great progress made in hydrographic
surveys, a considerable number of rocks and
shoals dangerous to navigation and not previously
shown on the charts are reported, averaging nearly 400
each year for the last six years, according to the British
reports. Of the 367 reported in 1906, 11 were discovered
by vessels striking them.</p>

<p>Immediate information in the form of <i>Notices to
Mariners</i> is published, of the more important corrections
to charts which can be made by hand. These corrections
show what charts are affected, and give sufficient
data for plotting.</p>

<p>In the case of extensive corrections or new surveys
a new edition of the chart is printed and all existing
copies of the previous edition are canceled.</p>

<p>It is important that the user of the chart shall make
certain that he has the latest edition and that all corrections
from its date of issue have been applied from the
<i>Notices to Mariners</i>.</p>

<p>It is unfortunately true that owing to failure to take
proper account of the notices, or to economy, old
editions or unconnected charts are sometimes used, and
in a number of cases the loss of vessels has been directly
due to this cause. Those responsible for the safe
navigation of vessels should insist that the latest editions
of charts are provided and that all charts to be used are
inspected and corrected to date.</p>

<h2><a name="READING_AND_USING_CHARTS" id="READING_AND_USING_CHARTS">READING AND USING CHARTS.</a></h2>


<p><b>Reading charts.</b> A chart is a representation on paper
of hydrographic and topographic information by means
of various conventional methods and symbols. It is
evidently important for those making use of charts
to understand the system and conventions used, and
to be able to interpret readily the various parts of
the chart. The ability to read a chart must include
an understanding of all its features, such as scale,
projection, geographic position, directions, depths,
plane of reference, aids to navigation, tides, currents,
elevations, topography, and date of survey and
publication.</p>

<p><b>Scale.</b> For American and British charts the scale is
usually expressed by the inches or fractions of an inch
to the minute or degree of latitude, or by the fractional
proportion of a distance on the map to the corresponding
distance on the earth. These fractions are sometimes
stated on the British charts, and nearly always
on those of the United States Coast Survey. The chart
catalogues give the scale in one or the other form. A
familiarity with the meaning of scales is of value in
selecting the most suitable chart, in judging of the
relative uses of charts, and in estimating distances.
Where the fractional scales are stated they furnish a
simple means of comparing charts, as, for instance, a
chart on <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>50000</span></span> scale will show all distances just twice
as long as a chart on <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>100000</span></span> scale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>The following are scale equivalents:</p>

</table></div>

<p>For use in measuring distances on large scale charts
the length of one or more nautical miles is usually
drawn on the chart, and sometimes scales are also given
in other units. On British charts the nautical mile
scale is divided into tenths (that is, cables of 100 fathoms
or 600 feet length); on the American charts into quarters
and eighths. Where the scale covers more than one
mile the fractional divisions are shown only for the left-hand
mile and the zero of the scale is placed between this
and the full mile scale, so that with dividers the full
miles and fraction may readily be taken off. The
nautical mile in the United States is taken to be the
length of a minute of arc of a great circle on a sphere
whose surface equals that of the earth; this definition
makes the nautical mile equal 6080.27 feet. Lecky
adopts 6080 feet as the nautical mile. The length of
the actual minute of latitude on the earth's surface
increases from 6046 feet at the equator to 6108 feet at
the poles, an increase of about one per cent. It is,
however, this somewhat variable unit of length which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
is ordinarily used in scaling distances on the sailing
charts.</p>

<p>On small scale charts there is usually a border scale
entirely around the chart, conveniently subdivided; this
serves the double purpose of facilitating the plotting or
reading of positions by latitude and longitude and of
furnishing a scale of minutes of latitude for use in
measuring distances. On a mercator chart this scale of
course varies with the latitude and it must be referred
to in the mean latitude of the distance to be measured.
In general practice the minute of latitude is taken as
equal to the nautical mile.</p>

<p><b>Projection.</b> On only a few charts is there a statement
of the projection used. Practically all general sailing
charts are on the mercator projection, which can be
readily recognized by the rectangular network of meridians
and parallels and the increase with latitude of the
distance between the parallels. On large scale local
and harbor charts the kind of projection used is not of
importance to navigation, as for such limited areas
the difference between projections would not affect the
use of the chart. On certain small scale charts of the
United States Coast Survey which are on the polyconic
projection this fact is stated on the chart, and can also
be readily recognized by the convergence of the meridians
and curvature of the parallels. Gnomonic charts
intended for taking off great circle courses are always
described in their titles and are also easily recognized
by the increased scale and distortion toward all the
borders. Charts of the polar regions are published
on several different projections, which are distinguished
from the mercator by their circular or curved parallels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Geographic position.</b> For large scale and harbor
charts the latitude and longitude of some point marked
on the chart are sometimes stated on the face of the
chart. For others of these, however, and for smaller
scale and general charts, positions are obtained by
reference to the border scale. There is a latitude
scale down either side of the chart, and a longitude
scale across the top and bottom. These scales are
conveniently subdivided into degrees, minutes, or
fractions of a minute. The minute is divided into
tenths (6´´), sixths (10´´), quarters (15´´), or halves
(30´´) on various charts.</p>

<p><b>Directions</b> are indicated on charts both by the projection
lines and by compass roses. Nearly all charts are
now oriented with the meridian, that is, north is the
top of the chart, and on a mercator chart the east and
west border lines are parallel with the meridians and
the north and south border lines with the parallels.
Formerly many charts were not so oriented. Some
of these are still in use and can readily be recognized
by the diagonal or inclined direction of the
projection lines with respect to the border of the chart.
Of course directions must not be referred to the border
lines of these diagonal charts, and scales along such
border lines must not be used. Directions with respect
to true north may always be referred to the projection
lines of the chart, but on a polyconic or polar chart
a direction must not be carried so far from any projection
line as to introduce error on account of convergence
of the meridians. Compass roses are placed on charts
to facilitate the taking off or laying down of directions,
though in some respects their use is less accurate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
convenient than the use of protractors, referring to
the projection lines. The British charts and many of
those of the United States Coast Survey have only
magnetic compasses, with degrees outside and points
inside, the former graduated to 90°. These are engraved
on the chart with the magnetic variation for the date
of publication, or for a few years in advance, and give
the annual change in the variation. Because of expense
of engraving they can be changed on the charts only
at intervals of some years, and until this is done allowance
for the change in variation is to be made if
important. The German charts and those of the
United States Hydrographic Office now have a threefold
compass, the outer one degrees true, the middle
degrees magnetic and the inner points magnetic; the
degrees in both cases are graduated to 360°, reading
from north through east, south, and west; thus northwest
would be stated as 315° instead of N. 45° W.
Small scale charts covering extensive areas have no
magnetic compasses. They sometimes have true compasses,
and usually have the isogonic lines, or lines of
equal magnetic variation, marked on them, from which
the variation at any intermediate point can be estimated.</p>

<p><b>Depths.</b> The unit used for depths is always stated
plainly on the chart, and it is important to note this
carefully, as the British, American, and Japanese charts
use fathoms for some charts and feet for others, and
most other countries use meters. Some of the earlier
charts of the United States coast have the depths inside
of the 18-foot curve in feet and outside of that curve in
fathoms.</p>

<p>Depth curves are shown on charts in order to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
clearly to the eye the different depth areas and the
limits for navigation of vessels of various drafts. The
shoaler areas are usually indicated by sanding the outer
limit or the entire area within the depth curve. For
the curves of greater depths various standard symbols
are used which vary slightly in the different series
but which may readily be recognized by the soundings
on either side of them. On the British charts the
1 and 3 fathom curves are usually indicated by sanding
the outer edge of the areas of these depths respectively;
beyond these the standard curves shown on these
charts are the 5, 10, 20, and 100 fathom curves. Similar
curves are used on the United States charts. The
German charts show the 2, 4, 6, 10, and 20 meter and
various deeper curves, and the French the 2, 5, 10, and
20 meter and deeper curves. On the United States
Lake Survey charts the areas included within the 6, 12,
and 18 foot curves are shaded with a blue tint, heavy
along the outer edge, which brings out strongly the
shoal areas.</p>

<p>Depth curves if clearly shown are a great aid in interpreting
the hydrography and making plain the shoals
and passages. The system of curves should always be
understood when using a chart, and it may sometimes
aid the navigator to trace out with a pencil an additional
curve, if needed, beyond the draft of his vessel. The
abbreviations used for the bottom characteristics are
explained either on the chart or on the sheet of chart
symbols, and give information which is useful in
anchoring, and may be helpful in identifying a position
by soundings. When a sounding is made without the
lead reaching bottom, the depth obtained is sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
shown on the chart by a short line and zero above the
figure, indicating that at the depth stated, bottom was
not obtained (no bottom). There are a few important
symbols shown in the water area of charts. The
sunken rock symbol indicates a dangerous area, or a
danger having a moderate depth of water over it, or a
rock the least water over which is not known; ordinarily
on the United States charts the least depth will be stated
when known, and the symbol omitted. The rock
awash symbol indicates a rock awash at some stage of
the tide, unless more definitely stated. The position
of a wreck is indicated by a special symbol. P. D.
(position doubtful) and E. D. (existence doubtful) are
placed after soundings or rocks or other features which
depend on some doubtful report not yet verified.</p>

<p>The following are the relations between depth units
found on various charts:</p>


<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p><b>Aids to navigation.</b> Each series of charts has a
definite system of representing the aids to navigation;
these are similar in principle but differ as to detail. The
characteristics of the lights, light-vessels, buoys, and
beacons are usually explained by abbreviations placed
by the side of each, and the entire system of representation
is given on the explanatory sheet for the charts.
Various methods of coloring lights and sectors and
buoys are in use on different charts. It is evidently of
importance that the user of the chart should readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
understand the significance of the navigational aids as
shown. For details regarding lights it is of course
desirable to refer to the light lists; for the coasts of the
United States detailed buoy lists are also published.
Range and channel lines when shown are represented
by distinctive symbols with bearings indicated. Danger
ranges for the avoidance of shoals are sometimes shown.
On the British charts bearings as stated on range and
channel lines are magnetic; the custom varies on other
charts and must be carefully noted in each case.</p>

<p><b>Plane of reference.</b> The soundings given on the
chart express the depth of water when the tide is at the
height adopted for the plane of reference; this same
plane is used in the tide tables, which thus will indicate
the amount to be added to the soundings when the tide
is above the plane, or to be subtracted when it is below.
In order to be on the safe side the plane of reference
adopted is always some low stage of the tide, so that
there is usually more water than shown on the chart.</p>

<p>On the British and German charts the soundings are
reduced to the mean low water of ordinary spring tides,
unless otherwise stated. On the charts of the Coast
and Geodetic Survey the following are the planes of
reference: for the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, the mean
of the low waters; for the Pacific coast, Alaska, and the
Philippines, the mean of the lower low waters, except
for Puget Sound and Wrangell Narrows, where planes
two and three feet lower respectively have been adopted.
According to the Tide Tables for 1908, at New York
(Sandy Hook) the tide will fall below the plane of
reference on 135 days during the year, but the extreme
low tide will be only one foot below the plane. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Portland, Maine, in 1908, the extreme low water is 2.1
feet below the plane, and at San Francisco 1.5 feet. Of
course when the tide is below the plane of reference the
amount must be subtracted from the depths shown on
the chart.</p>

<p>Strong winds and unusual barometric pressure may
have a marked effect on the height of tide, so that it may
differ appreciably from the predicted height, which is of
course based on normal conditions. At Baltimore and
at Willets Point observation shows that a heavy wind
may reduce the tide four feet below the predicted heights.</p>

<p><b>Tides.</b> Information regarding tides is given on all
large scale charts, and additional information and predictions
may be found in the Tide Tables. On the
charts of the United States coast there is a small tide
table giving for the high and low waters the time relations
to the moon's transit and the height relations to
the plane of reference. On the British charts there is
a brief statement as to the tides either at the port on
the chart or in the general notes; this ordinarily gives
the interval in hours and minutes between the moon's
meridian passage and the time of high water for the
periods of full and new moon, and also the amount in
feet that the spring and neap tides rise above the plane
of reference, and the range of the neap tide. The
following is an example of such a tide note: "H. W. F.
and C. Campbellton IV<sup>h</sup> 0<sup>m</sup>. Springs rise 10 feet,
Neaps 7 feet."</p>

<p>At some important ports information as to the state
of the tide is given to vessels, either by means of signal
balls, or by automatic tidal indicators, as at the Narrows
in New York Harbor, where a large dial shows to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
passing vessels the height of the tide, and an arrow
indicates whether it is rising or falling.</p>

<p>The tidal information becomes important and must
be considered in navigation or in anchoring in waters
where the available depth at low water approximates
the draft of the vessel. In the general use of coast
charts it is also important to observe the effect of the
stage of tide on the appearance of many features.
Rocks rising some feet above low water may be entirely
submerged at high water. In some areas the aspect
may be radically changed between high and low water
by the baring of extensive shoals or reefs.</p>

<p><b>Currents.</b> Information, when available, as to currents
is given either by a note or by current arrows
placed on the chart at the position of observation.
Additional information as to certain regions is given
in the United States Tide Tables. Tidal currents,
flood and ebb, and currents not due to tidal action are
distinguished by symbols, and the velocity is given
in knots, and on some charts is indicated by the lengths
of the arrows.</p>

<p>Complete and systematic current observations have
been made in comparatively few localities because of
the time and expense necessary to get the full information
as to the variations of the currents with the tides
and seasons. Ordinarily therefore the current arrows
shown on charts indicate only the average direction
and velocity, or possibly only the conditions existing
at the season when the survey was made. Oceanic
and coast currents are probably much less uniform
than might be inferred from the current streams
drawn on maps and charts. A more systematic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
investigation of ocean currents is required to fulfill
the needs of navigation.</p>

<p>The tidal currents seldom turn with the tides, and
there may be an interval of as much as three hours
between the time of high tide or low tide and slack
water. This leads to the apparent anomaly that in
cases the current may be running with its greatest
velocity at the time of high or low water, and may be
running into a channel for several hours after the tide
commences to fall. It is therefore, evidently, not safe
to draw inferences as to currents solely from the tidal
heights.</p>

<p>There are passages where the tidal currents become of
the greatest importance to navigation, as, for instance,
in Seymour Narrows on the inside route to Alaska,
where the current velocity reaches 12 knots and the
interval of apparent slack water lasts but a few
minutes.</p>

<p><b>Elevations.</b> The unit used for elevations is also
stated on the face of the chart, as also the plane to
which elevations are referred. On the United States
charts this is generally mean high water and on British
charts the high water of ordinary spring tides. Rocks
and islets usually have figures shown beside them,
either in brackets or underscored, which indicate the
height above high water. Rocks which are bare at
low water sometimes have a note "dries" or "bares"
so many feet, indicating their height above low tide,
although they are covered at high tide. The British
charts in some regions where there is a large range of
tide have underlined figures in the area between high
water and low water indicating the heights above low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
water, or the depths of water over the bank at high
water, as explained in each case.</p>

<p><b>Topography.</b> The land area on most charts is
distinguished from the water area by a stipple or tint;
on some charts the topographic features have, however,
been depended upon to bring out the land from the
water. The solid shore line is the high-water line,
and should be clear on the chart; the area between
high and low water is sanded or otherwise shaded on
all charts. The relief of the land is represented by
hill shading or by contour lines which are the successive
curves of elevation on the land. Topographic
symbols are used for some of the more important
features, such as cliffs, rocky ledges, buildings, bridges,
trees, roads, etc. It is important for the navigator
to understand the significance of the hill representation
and the symbols, as they will aid him in recognizing a
coast or island, and in identifying landmarks.</p>

<p><b>Date of survey and publication.</b> There is usually an
authority note on each chart showing the source of
information or date of survey; if on a coast subject to
change, the latter is important. On the United States
Coast Survey charts the date of publication of the
edition is given, and on British and other charts the
date of both large and small corrections. The chart
catalogues give the dates of the last editions, or the
dates of extensive corrections, and this affords a means
of seeing whether the copy of the chart in use is the
latest edition available.</p>

<p><b>Chart working.</b> In crossing the open and deep portions
of the ocean, where the only data given may be
the projection lines and soundings far deeper than can
be reached with navigational sounding machines, the
chart is used to lay out in advance the general course
to be followed and to plot the positions of the vessel at
intervals either as determined by observations or, lacking
these, by dead reckoning. When necessary the
courses of the vessel are modified as the plotted positions
are found to fall one side or the other of the proposed
general track.</p>

<p>The principal operations on a chart are plotting or
taking off positions by latitude and longitude, laying
down or taking off bearings, directions, and courses,
plotting or measuring distances, and laying down or
taking off angles.</p>

<p>To plot a position by its latitude and longitude on
a mercator chart, set a parallel ruler on the adjacent
parallel and then move it to the required latitude as
shown by the border scale at either side; then with a
pair of dividers at the upper or lower longitude border
scale take the distance from the nearest meridian and
lay this distance off along the edge of the parallel ruler.
The latitude and longitude of a point are taken from the
chart by reversing this process, or with the dividers
only. A direction is laid down on the chart or read
from the chart preferably by using some form of pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>tractor
and measuring the angle from the projection
lines. In this country it is more commonly done by
carrying the direction with a parallel ruler either from
or to a compass rose printed on the chart. Distances
are measured or laid down on a mercator chart by using
the latitude border scale for the middle latitude. On
polyconic and other larger scale charts distances are
measured from the scales printed on the chart. It
should be remarked that in general where special
accuracy is required distances should be computed and
not scaled from any chart, because of the error due to
the distortion of paper in printing.</p>

<p>The use of protractors on charts in plotting by
angles in the three-point problem will be referred to
later.</p>

<p>The course to be steered to allow for a set due to
current or wind may be obtained by a graphical solution
on the chart, though it will be preferable to do this on
other paper, using a larger scale. (<a href="#Fig38">Fig. 38.</a>) The direction
and velocity of the set and the course and speed of the
ship may be considered as two sides of a parallelogram of
forces, of which the diagonal is the distance and course
made good. To obtain the course to steer to reach a
given point with a given current and speed of vessel,
lay down the direction of the destination; from the
starting point lay off the direction of set and the amount
in one hour; from the extremity of this describe an arc
with radius equal to the speed of the vessel in one hour.
A line drawn from the extremity of the direction of
set to the point of intersection of the arc and the course
to be made good will give the direction of the course to
be steered, and the point of intersection will also be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
estimated position of the vessel at the end of the hour's
run.</p>

<p><b>Methods of locating a vessel.</b> The principal methods
used for locating the position of a vessel are by astronomical
observations, by dead reckoning, by compass
bearings, by ranges, by horizontal angles, by soundings,
by vertical angles, and by sound. The full discussion
of these methods pertains to navigation and pilotage,
and they will be only briefly referred to here as to their
graphical application to charts.</p>

<p><b>Astronomical methods.</b> There are a number of
methods of obtaining the position of a vessel by astronomical
observations. When the position is computed
the chart enters into these only in the plotting of the
final result, so that with one exception these methods
will not be referred to further here.</p>

<p>The elegant method discovered by an American seaman,
Captain Sumner, in 1843, is in part graphical, to
be worked out upon the chart. This method is based
on the obvious fact that at any instant there is a point
on the earth having the sun in its zenith and which is
the center of circles on the earth's surface along the
circumference of any one of which the sun's altitude is
the same at all points. A short portion of such a circle
may be considered as a straight line and can be determined
by locating one point and its direction, or two
points in it. This is known as a Sumner line. (<a href="#Fig39">Fig. 39.</a>)</p>

<p>From an observation of the sun's altitude and azimuth
and an assumed latitude a position is computed
and plotted and a line drawn on the chart through this
position at right angles to the azimuth of the sun as
taken from the azimuth tables and laid off from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 127-129]</a></span>
meridian. Another method is to compute positions with
two assumed latitudes and plot the two resulting positions
and draw a line through them. The vessel must
be somewhere on the resulting Sumner line. A good
determination may be obtained by the intersection of
two Sumner lines obtained from two observations of
the sun with sufficient interval so that there will be a
change of azimuth of as much as 30 degrees to give a fair
intersection. Allowance must be made for the movement
of the vessel between the two observations by
drawing a line parallel to the first and at a distance
equal to the distance made good. An excellent intersection
may be obtained by observation of the sun, and
before or after it of a star in the twilight at a different
azimuth.</p>

<p>Even a single Sumner line, however, furnishes valuable
information, as it may be combined with other
sources of information to obtain an approximation to
the position. The vessel must be somewhere on this
line, and this gives a good check on the position by dead
reckoning, or an intersection may be obtained with a
line or bearing of a distant land object, or a line of
soundings may be compared on the chart with the
Sumner line.</p>

<p>If an observation is taken when the observed heavenly
body is bearing abeam, it is evident that the resulting
Sumner line will be the direction of the course of the
vessel, and this fact may be useful in shaping the course
when nearing the land or a danger.</p>

<p><b>Dead reckoning.</b> When impossible to obtain the
position by any other means, it is computed or plotted
from the last determined position, using the courses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
and distances run as shown by compass and log and
allowing for effect of current and wind. Because of
uncertainties in all these elements, positions so obtained
may be from five to twenty miles in error in a two-hundred-mile
run, depending of course to some extent
on the speed of the vessel.</p>

<p><b>Compass bearings.</b> A compass bearing of a single
object, as a lighthouse or a tangent to a point of land,
laid down on the chart, shows that the vessel is somewhere
on that line, and when combined with other
information, as with a Sumner line or the course by dead
reckoning or the distance by a vertical angle, will give
a position whose correctness of course depends on the
accuracy of the data used. Bearings of two objects not
in the same direction give two lines on the chart whose
intersection is the position. This will be very weak
if the angle of intersection is acute, and will become
stronger as it approaches a right angle. A bearing of
a third object should be taken when practicable, as it
affords a valuable check in that the three lines should
intersect in the same point; if they do not do so when
plotted the error is either in the observations, or the
compass, or the plotting, or the chart. (<a href="#Fig40">Fig. 40</a>). All
compass bearings are of course dependent upon the
accuracy of the compass and the knowledge of its errors
due to the local magnetic effect of the ship, and also
upon the correctness with which the magnetic variation
from true north is known. Bearings of near objects
should therefore always be preferred, and those of distant
objects considered as giving only approximate positions.
An error of one degree in the bearing of an object
30 miles away will deflect the plotted line about one-half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
mile. Because of the facility with which they may be
taken compass bearings are much used for inshore
navigation, but in point of reliability they are inferior
to some of the other methods.</p>

<p>A single or "danger" bearing of an object is often
a valuable guide in avoiding a danger. For example,
a reef may lie to the westward of a line drawn South
10° East from a lighthouse; in approaching a vessel
will pass safely to the eastward of the reef if the lighthouse
is not allowed to bear any to the northward of
North 10° West. (<a href="#Fig41">Fig. 41.</a>)</p>

<p>Two successive bearings of a single object, as, for
instance, a lighthouse, noting the distance run in the
interval, afford a convenient and much used means
of locating the position with respect to that object.
Such bearings are drawn on the chart in reversed
direction from the object. The distance run between
the bearings, as read by the log and corrected for
current if practicable, is scaled off with dividers and
the course of the vessel is set off with parallel ruler;
the latter is then moved across the two plotted directions
until the distance intercepted between them equals that
scaled with the dividers, and the edge of the ruler then
represents the track of the vessel. (<a href="#Fig42">Fig. 42.</a>) If the angle
from the bow, or from the course of the vessel, for the
second bearing is double that for the first bearing, the
distance from the object at the second bearing is equal
to that run by the vessel in the interval, and the use of
this simple relation is designated as "doubling the angle
on the bow." If the angles between the course and
the object are respectively 45° and 90° when the two
bearings are taken on an object on the shore, the dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>tance
that the ship passes offshore when the object
is abeam is equal to the distance run between the two
bearings; this is a much used navigational device,
known as the "bow and beam bearing" or the "four-point
bearing." There is an advantage, however,
in using bearings at two and four points (or 22.5°
and 45°), as these give the probable distance that the
object will be passed before it is abeam.</p>

<p><b>Ranges.</b> A valuable line of position is obtained by
noting when two well-situated objects are in range,
that is, one back of the other in the line of sight from
the vessel, as, for instance, a church spire appearing
behind a lighthouse or a rock in line with a prominent
point. Such ranges are of course entirely free from
compass errors, and should be noted whenever there is
favorable opportunity. The value of the range in plotting
will increase with the distance between the objects,
and if the two are close in proportion to the distance
to the vessel the direction will be weak owing to the
uncertainty in drawing a direction through close points.
Artificial ranges are often erected as aids to navigation,
usually to indicate the course to be followed in passing
through a channel. Ranges afford a valuable guide in
avoiding dangers, as for example an inspection of the
chart may show that if a certain lighthouse is kept in line
with or open from an islet a dangerous shoal will be given
a good berth; on coasts not well buoyed such danger
ranges are sometimes marked on the charts. (<a href="#Fig43">Fig. 43.</a>)</p>

<p><b>Horizontal sextant angles.</b> The location of a position
by the three-point problem, using sextant angles,
is much more exact than by bearings, but is less used
because not so well known and also because additional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 133-135]</a></span>
instruments are required and the conditions are not
always favorable. It is so valuable a method, however,
that it should be used, when necessary, on every well-equipped
vessel. A single horizontal angle taken
with a sextant between objects, as two lighthouses,
defines the position of the vessel as somewhere on the
circumference of a circle passing through the two
objects and the vessel. A protractor laid on the
chart with two of its arms set at the observed angle
and passing through the two objects, will permit of
locating two or more points of this circle on the chart.
This furnishes a line of position which may be combined
with other information to locate the vessel.
With a compass bearing of one of the objects the
position may be plotted directly from the single angle.
Two sextant angles measured at the same instant
between three objects furnish one of the most accurate
means of locating the position of a vessel, this being
the same method that is ordinarily used in hydrographic
surveying, known as the three-point problem. (<a href="#Fig44">Fig. 44.</a>)
The two angles are conveniently set off on a three-arm
protractor, which is shifted on the chart until the three
arms touch the three points, when the position of the
center is plotted. A third angle to a fourth point
furnishes a valuable check in case of doubt. Two
angles may also be taken to four objects without any
common point, and in this case portions of the two
circles of position are plotted and their intersection
will be the ship's position.</p>

<p>The value of this method depends largely on the
selection of favorably located objects, and it is quite
important that the principles of the three-point problem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
be understood. If the ship is on or near the circumference
of a circle which passes through the three
objects the position will be very weak, and the same
is true if the distance between any two of the objects
is small as compared with the distance from them to
the vessel. A useful general rule is that the position
will be strong if the middle one of the three objects
is the nearest to the vessel, provided that no two of
the objects are close together in comparison with the
distance to the vessel.</p>

<p>A single sextant angle furnishes a means of avoiding a
known danger by using what is known as the horizontal
"danger angle." (<a href="#Fig45">Fig. 45.</a>) Note two well-defined objects
on the coast either side of the danger to be avoided and
describe a circle through them and passing sufficiently
outside of the reef to give it a safe berth. With a protractor
on the chart note the angle between the objects
at any point on the outer part of this circle. If in
passing, the angle at the ship between the two objects
is not allowed to become greater than this "danger
angle" the danger will be given a sufficient berth. This
method as well as any use of sextant angles or bearings
depends of course on the accuracy of the chart, and
caution must be used where it is not certain that the
chart depends upon an accurate survey.</p>

<p><b>Soundings.</b> Even if objects cannot be seen, due to
distance or thick weather, the chart furnishes a valuable
aid when a vessel has approached within the limits
where it is practicable to obtain soundings. Modern
navigational sounding machines permit of obtaining
soundings to depths of nearly one hundred fathoms
without stopping the vessel. A rough check is at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 137-139]</a></span>
obtained by comparing such soundings with those
given on the chart for the position carried forward by
dead reckoning. If a number of soundings are taken
and plotted on a piece of tracing paper, spaced by the
log readings to the scale of the chart, and this tracing
paper is laid over the chart and shifted in the vicinity
of the probable position until the soundings best agree
with those on the chart, a valuable verification of position
may be obtained. This is particularly the case if
the area has been well surveyed, and the soundings
taken on the vessel are accurate, and the configuration
of the bottom has marked characteristics. For instance,
in approaching New York the crossing of the 30, 20, and
10 fathom curves will give a fair warning of the distance
off the Long Island and New Jersey coasts, and soundings
across such a feature as the submerged Hudson
gorge extending to the southeastward of Sandy Hook
will give a valuable indication of position. The taking
of soundings should be resorted to even in favorable
conditions, in approaching shoal water, as a check on
other means of locating the vessel. Many marine
disasters are attributed to failure to make sufficient use
of the lead, the simplest of navigational aids.</p>

<p><b>Vertical angles.</b> The vertical angle of elevation of an
object whose height is known will give the distance, and
combined with a bearing or other information this permits
of locating a vessel where better means cannot be
used. Distance tables are published for this method.
(<a href="#Fig46">Fig. 46.</a>) The vertical angle is measured with a sextant
and must be the angle at the ship between the top of the
object and the sea level vertically beneath it; for a hill
or mountain, therefore, the eye of the observer should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
be near the water. The object should not be so distant
that curvature becomes appreciable. The "vertical
danger angle" is a means of avoiding a known danger,
on a principle similar to that of the horizontal danger
angle; that is, the angle of elevation of a known object
is not permitted to become greater than a fixed amount
depending on the distance from the object to the danger
to be avoided.</p>

<p><b>Positions by sound.</b> In thick weather sound affords
a valuable aid to the navigator. In narrow passages
noting the echo of the whistle from a cliff is a method
resorted to, as for instance in Puget Sound and along
the Alaska coast. Fog whistles and bell buoys are
maintained at many places. Submarine bells have
recently been introduced at a number of points along
the Atlantic coast, and vessels may be equipped to receive
these submarine signals transmitted through the water,
which indicate also the general direction from which
the sound comes.</p>

<p><b>Need of vigilance.</b> Too great importance cannot be
attached to frequent verification of positions by the best
available means, particularly when approaching the
land. Neglect of this or overconfidence has caused
many disasters. A notable instance was the loss of one
of the largest Pacific steamers on the coast of Japan in
March, 1907. In the afternoon of a clear day this
vessel ran on to a well-known reef about a mile from a
lighthouse, resulting in the total loss of vessel and cargo
valued at three and a half million dollars. The captain
was so confident of his position and that he was giving
the reef a sufficient berth that he laid down no bearings
on the chart and took no soundings.</p>

PLOTTING BEARING OF A LIGHTHOUSE.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span><b>Instruments.</b> The principal instruments needed for
use with charts are; dividers for taking off distances and
latitudes and longitudes, parallel ruler for transferring
directions to or from a compass rose and for taking off
or plotting the latitude on a mercator chart, protractor of
180 degrees for reading the angle with the meridian of any
direction or for laying off on the chart any given angle with
the meridian, and three-arm or other full-circle protractor
for plotting a position by the three-point problem.</p>

<p>Parallel rulers on the principle of Field's are strongly
recommended for chart work, as they combine in a
single instrument the advantages of a parallel ruler
and a 180-degree protractor. Any direction can be
read or laid off by simply moving the parallel ruler
to the nearest projection line, which is a process not
only more convenient than referring to the compass
rose printed on the chart but also more accurate
because of the longer radius. These instruments
can also be used the same as a plain parallel ruler.
Field's parallel rulers are made in two forms, one rolling
and the other sliding. The former is a single ruler
with edge graduated 90 degrees either way, and
mounted on rollers; it is the most rapid instrument
for reading or laying off a direction, but it requires
a smooth surface. The latter is an ordinary two-bar
parallel ruler with edge when closed graduated
90 degrees either way; it is a very serviceable instrument
and probably more to be depended upon for ordinary
use than the rolling form. Some form of combined
protractor and parallel ruler should be in every navigational
equipment, and it is unfortunate that these
instruments are not better known in this country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
There are other forms of half-circle protractors which
are used on the same principle, that is, of bringing
the center on to a projection line and reading where
the line cuts the border graduation of the protractor.
Thus a semicircular protractor is used with a separate
straight edge, along which it is slid to the nearest
meridian; another form is the simple circular protractor
with a thread fastened at the center. All these
forms of protractors, it will be noted, are intended to
work from the true meridian, and they are usually
graduated in degrees only; the use of degrees instead
of points is becoming much more general in navigational
work, and reference to the true meridian is also more
common than formerly.</p>

<p>The standard three-arm protractor, or station
pointer, as it is known to the English, should be a part
of every navigational outfit because of its value in
locating a position by the three-point problem. A
recent American invention, Court's three-arm protractor,
is an instrument made of celluloid for the
same purpose. It should not be considered as a
substitute for the standard metal instrument, but it
is a simple, cheap, and handy supplement to it, as it
may be readily used for small angles and short distances
where there are mechanical difficulties in working
with the metal three-arm protractor. Other protractors
can be used for the three-point problem, as, for
instance, Cust's protractor on celluloid, on which the
angles are drawn in pencil and erased, and the tracing-paper
protractor.</p>

<p><b>Degree of reliance on charts.</b> The value of a chart
must not be judged alone from its general appearance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 145-147]</a></span>
as skill in preparation and publication may give a
handsome appearance to an incomplete survey. On
the other hand a thorough survey might through poor
preparation result in a chart defective either in information
or in utility.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;">

<p class="caption">FIG. 48. THREE-ARM PROTRACTOR IN USE ON A CHART, PLOTTING POSITION FROM
TWO ANGLES.</p>
</div>

<p>The degree of completeness of the soundings, the
character of the region, and the date of the survey
should be taken into account in deciding as to the
amount of reliance to be placed on the chart. Areas
where the soundings are not distributed with fair
uniformity may be assumed not to have been completely
surveyed. Caution should be used in navigating on
charts where the survey is not complete, and even where
careful surveys exist care must be taken if the bottom
is of very irregular nature with lumps near the navigable
depth, as for instance on some of the coral
reef coasts. Isolated soundings shoaler than the surrounding
depths should be avoided, as there may be
less water than shown. In such a region, unless the
whole area is dragged, it is impossible to make it
entirely certain that all obstructions are charted.</p>

<p>While an immense amount of faithful work has
been put into the preparation of many charts, the
user must constantly exercise his own judgment as to
the reliance to be placed on them. A coast is not
to be considered as clear unless it is shown to be; buoys
may get adrift and be in a different position or be
gone altogether; fog signals vary in distinctness owing
to atmospheric conditions; extreme or unusual tides
may fall below the plane of reference; owing to strong
winds the actual tide may differ from the predicted
tide. Errors sometimes creep in from various sources,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
such as those due to different reference longitudes
or the use of a corrected longitude for a portion of the
chart without changing other positions to which the
same correction is applicable; clerical and printing
errors may occur; there are sometimes omissions in
surveys; a feature may get plotted in two different
positions; tide rips are reported as breakers and
floating objects as rocks or islands, and thus many
dangers have gotten on the charts which cannot be
found again, and false reports are sometimes made to
shield some one from blame. Most of these classes
of errors and uncertainties, however, disappear in the
use of charts of a thoroughly surveyed coast.</p>

<p><b>Use the latest editions of charts.</b> The latest edition
of a chart should always be used and should be corrected
for all notices since its issue. Carelessness or false
economy in not providing the largest scale or the latest
chart has been the cause of more than one marine
disaster.</p>

<p>The British Board of Trade issue the following
official notice to shipowners and agents: "The attention
of the Board of Trade has frequently been called to
cases in which British vessels have been endangered or
wrecked through the masters' attempting to navigate
them by means of antiquated or otherwise defective
charts. The Board of Trade desires, therefore, to
direct the especial attention of shipowners and their
agents to the necessity of seeing that the charts taken or
sent on board their ships are corrected to the time of
sailing. Neglect to supply a ship with proper charts
will be brought prominently before the Court of Inquiry
in the event of a wreck occurring from that cause."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>The following is a translation of a notice in the
preface to the catalogue of charts published by the
German government: "Owners and masters of vessels
are apprised that cases of marine accidents in which the
casualty was due to antiquated or erroneous charts,
have frequently been before the admiralty courts. In
consequence of this, the 'Instructions for the prevention
of accidents to steamers and sailing vessels,' issued by
the Seeberufsgenossenschaft have been amended by the
following additional paragraph: 'It is obligatory upon
every master, except when engaged in local coastwise
navigation, to keep the Notices to Mariners regularly,
and with the aid of them to carefully keep his charts
up to date.'"</p>

<p>The British shipping laws provide that a ship may
not be sent to sea in such an unseaworthy state that the
life of any person is thereby endangered, and the House
of Lords has defined the term "seaworthy" to mean "in
a fit state as to repairs, equipment, and crew, and in all
other respects, to encounter the ordinary perils of the
voyage." Proper charts and sailing directions are a
necessary part of the equipment of a vessel, and the
courts have frequently inquired into this.</p>

<p>The records of the British courts, however, show that
even in recent years many ships have been damaged
or lost owing directly or indirectly to failure to have
the latest information on board. The following are
instances from these records.</p>

<p>In 1890 the steamer <i>Dunluce</i> was lost owing to the
use of an old edition of the Admiralty chart which
showed a depth of 4<span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>2</span></span> fathoms on the Wikesgrund,
whereas the later chart showed much less water. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
this case the master had requested his ship chandler to
send him the latest chart.</p>

<p>In 1891 the steamer <i>St. Donats</i> got ashore on a
patch which was not shown on the chart in use, which
was privately published in 1881; the danger was, however,
shown on the Admiralty chart corrected to 1889.</p>

<p>Also in 1891 the steamer <i>Trent</i> was lost on the
Missipezza Rock in the Adriatic. The ship was navigated
by a private chart published in 1890 which did
not show this rock, and by sailing directions published
in 1866.</p>

<p>The steamer <i>Aboraca</i>, stranded in the Gulf of
Bothnia in 1894, was being navigated by a chart corrected
to 1881 which did not show that the Storkallagrund
light-vessel had been moved eight miles.</p>

<p>The steamer <i>Ravenspur</i> was lost on Bilbao Breakwater
owing to the use of a chart not up to date which
did not show the breakwater. In 1898 the steamer
<i>Cromarty</i> was lost in attempting to enter Ponta
Delgada harbor, and in 1901 the steamer "Dinnington"
was lost by steaming on to the new breakwater in
Portland harbor; both of these disasters were likewise
due to the use of old charts which did not show the
breakwaters. In these three cases the masters of the
vessels had authority to obtain the necessary charts at
the owners' expense.</p>

<p>Not so, however, in the following case from the
finding of a British marine court in 1877: "The primary
cause of the ship's getting on shore was due to the
master's being guided in his navigation by an obsolete
Admiralty chart dated September 1, 1852, and corrected
to April, 1862, and on which no lights are shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
to exist either in ... or ... and to his not being
supplied with the latest sailing directions. The Court,
considering that the master was obliged to furnish
himself with chronometer, barometer, sextant, charts,
sailing directions, and everything necessary for the
navigation of his vessel out of his private resources,
which, under very favorable circumstances, might perhaps
reach £150 a year, find themselves unable in this
instance to pass a heavier censure upon him than that
he be severely reprimanded."</p>

<p>The loss of the German steamer <i>Baker</i> on the coast
of Cuba on January 31, 1908, was declared by the
marine court at Hamburg to be due in part to the use
of an unofficial chart which did not show the latest
surveys on that coast.</p>

<p><b>Use the largest scale charts.</b> The largest scale chart
available should be employed when entering channels,
bays, or harbors, as it gives information with more
clearness and detail, positions may be more accurately
plotted, and sometimes it is the first corrected for new
information.</p>

<p>The records of the courts of inquiry also show
cases where vessels have been wrecked owing to the use
of charts of too small scale.</p>

<p>In 1890 the steamer <i>Lady Ailsa</i> was lost on the
Plateau du Four. The only chart on board for this
locality was a general chart of the Bay of Biscay,
and the stranding was due to the master's mistaking
one buoy for another. The court found that the
chart, although a proper one for general use, was not
sufficient for the navigation of a vessel in such narrow
waters and on such a dangerous coast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Zenobia</i> was stranded on the San Thomé
Bank in 1891. On this vessel the owners were to
furnish the chronometers and the master the charts
and sailing directions. The master was, however,
apparently satisfied with only a general chart of the
South Atlantic for navigation on the coast of Brazil,
and had no sailing directions at all.</p>

<p><b>The depth curves</b> on charts furnish a valuable guide,
and if the curves are lacking or broken in some parts
it is usually a sign that the information is incomplete.
The 100-fathom curve is a general warning of approach
to the coast. The 10-fathom curve on rocky coasts
should be considered as a danger curve, and caution
used after crossing it. The 5-fathom curve is the
most important for modern vessels of medium draft,
as it indicates for them the practical limit of navigation.
The 3, 2, and 1-fathom curves are a guide to
smaller vessels, but have less significance than formerly
because of the increase of draft of vessels.</p>

<p><b>The shrinkage of paper</b>, especially in plate printing,
has been referred to. This introduces two possible
sources of error: first, the shrinkage being different
in the two directions, any scale printed on the chart
will be accurate only when used in a direction parallel
to itself; second, for the same reason, angles and
directions will be somewhat distorted. Fortunately
these errors are not serious in the ordinary navigational
use of a chart, but they should not be overlooked when
accurate plotting or measuring of distances is attempted
on a plate-printed chart.</p>

<p>The actual shrinkage measured on charts printed
from plates varies from <span class="fraction"><span>1</span><span>3</span></span> inch to 1 inch in a length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
of chart of 36 inches. On British and American plate
printed charts the shrinkage is usually from two to
nearly three times as much in one direction as it is in
the other.</p>

<p><b>Care of charts.</b> In order that they may be properly
used charts should be filed flat and not rolled. They
should be systematically arranged so that the desired
chart can be instantly found. They should be cared
for and when in bad condition replaced by new copies.
They can be most conveniently filed in shallow drawers,
thus avoiding the placing of many charts in a single
drawer. The latter is a common fault; it not only
increases the labor of handling the charts but adds
to the liability of their injury.</p>

<h2><a name="PUBLICATIONS_SUPPLEMENTING_NAUTICAL" id="PUBLICATIONS_SUPPLEMENTING_NAUTICAL">PUBLICATIONS SUPPLEMENTING NAUTICAL
CHARTS.</a></h2>


<p>There are several publications in book and in chart
form which are either necessary or convenient for use
in connection with nautical charts. These comprise
the coast pilots, notices to mariners, tide tables, light
and buoy lists, and various special charts.</p>

<p><b>Coast pilots</b>, or sailing directions, are books giving
descriptions of the main features, as far as of interest
to seamen, of the coast and adjacent waters, with
directions for navigation. They contain much miscellaneous
information of value to the mariner, especially
the stranger. Although they contain additional facts
which cannot be shown on the charts, they are not at
all intended to supersede the latter; the mariner should
in general rely on the charts. The sailing directions
can be less readily corrected than the charts, and in all
cases where they differ the charts are to be taken as the
guide.</p>

<p>The most extensive series of sailing directions is
that published by the British Admiralty, comprising
fifty-six volumes and including all the navigable regions
of the world. In the United States the Coast and
Geodetic Survey publishes ten volumes of coast pilots
for the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts, Porto Rico,
and southeastern Alaska, and eight volumes of sailing
directions for Alaska and the Philippine Islands.
The United States Hydrographic Office publishes six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>teen
volumes of sailing directions for various parts of
the world.</p>

<p><b>Notices to Mariners</b> are published at frequent intervals,
giving all important corrections, which should be
at once applied by hand to the charts, such as rocks
or shoals discovered and lights and buoys established
or moved. New charts, new editions, and canceled
charts are also announced.</p>

<p>These notices should be carefully examined and the
necessary corrections made on all charts of the sets in
use on the vessel. A chart should be considered as a
growing rather than a finished instrument, and constant
watchfulness is required to see that it is kept up to
date. Neglect of this may cause shipwreck, as the following
instance shows. Report came to Manila in
1904 that there was a low sand islet lying off the very
poorly charted northeast coast of Samar; this information
was promptly published in the local Notice to
Mariners. About a month later a small steamer was
sent to land some native constabulary on that coast.
The captain failed to obtain or observe this notice,
and approached the coast before daylight on a course
which led directly across the sand islet. The vessel
was driven far up on the sand, where it still lies.</p>

<p>In the United States, weekly Notices to Mariners
are published by the Department of Commerce and
Labor for the coasts under the jurisdiction of the
United States, and by the Navy Department for all
regions. These notices are distributed free and can
be obtained from chart agents and consular officers.
In Great Britain the notices are published at frequent
intervals by the Hydrographic Office, and practically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
all countries issuing charts also issue such notices.
Information as to important changes in lights and
other announcements of navigational interest are also
sometimes printed in the marine columns of newspapers
and in nautical periodicals.</p>

<p><b>Tide Tables.</b> Brief information as to the time and
height of the tide is usually for convenience given on
the face of the chart. More complete information is
published in the Tide Tables, with which every navigator
should be provided. "The Tide Tables for
United States and foreign ports," published annually
in advance by the United States Coast and Geodetic
Survey, give complete predictions of the time and
height of high and low water for each day of the year
for 70 of the principal ports of the world, and the tidal
differences from some principal port for 3000 subordinate
ports. The other leading nations also publish
annual tide tables; those of the British government
are entitled "Tide Tables for British and Irish ports,
and also the times of high water for the principal
places on the globe."</p>

<p><b>Light and buoy lists.</b> Brief information as to all
artificial aids to navigation is shown on the charts.
Every vessel should also have on board the latest
official light and buoy lists, which give a more detailed
description than can be placed on the charts.</p>

<p>Light and buoy lists for the coasts of the United States
are published annually by the Light-House Board.
The United States Hydrographic Office publishes a
"List of Lights of the World" (excepting the United
States), in three volumes.</p>

<p>The British Hydrographic Office publishes eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
volumes of Lists of Lights, and these are corrected
annually.</p>

<p><b>Chart catalogues</b> are published in connection with
all series of charts. They give the particulars and
price of each chart published, and are usually arranged
in geographical order, with both alphabetical and
numerical indexes, for convenience in finding charts
either by position, name, or number.</p>

<p><b>Charts for special purposes.</b> There are various
special charts published for the benefit of mariners,
although not intended for direct use in plotting the
course of a vessel or in locating its position. Some
of the more important of these are mentioned below.</p>

<p><b>Gnomonic charts</b> are intended solely for laying down
the great circle or shortest practicable courses between
points, for which purpose they are very convenient.
Their use has already been described. The United
States Hydrographic Office publishes six such charts,
for the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, Pacific, North
Pacific, South Pacific, and Indian Oceans.</p>

<p><b>Current charts</b> are published by the British Hydrographic
Office for the various oceans; these usually
show the average ocean currents, but for the Atlantic
there are monthly and for the Pacific quarterly current
charts.</p>

<p><b>Magnetic variation charts</b> are published by both the
United States and British governments. They show
on a mercator chart of the world the isogonic lines,
or lines along which the variation of the needle from
true north is the same. The lines are drawn for each
degree of variation. The annual change in the variation
is also indicated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>Other magnetic charts are published showing the
lines of equal magnetic dip, horizontal magnetic force,
and vertical magnetic force.</p>

<p><b>Meteorological ocean charts</b> are published by several
governments, including the United States, Great
Britain, and Germany, and give the average weather
conditions, winds, fogs, currents, ice, tracks of storms,
and other information. "Pilot charts" of the North
Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans are issued by the
United States Hydrographic Office about the first of
each month, and give "a forecast of the weather for the
ensuing and a review of that for the preceding month,
together with all obtainable information as to the most
available sailing and steam routes, dangers to navigation,
ice, fog, derelicts, etc., and any additional information
that may be received of value to navigation." Mariners
in all parts of the world have joined in contributing
the information which has been used in compiling
these pilot charts.</p>

<p><b>Track charts</b> are published by the British and
United States governments. That of the latter is
entitled "Track and distance chart of the world, showing
the routes traversed by full-powered steamers
between the principal ports of the world, and the
corresponding distances."</p>

<p><b>Telegraph charts</b> are published showing the "telegraphic
connections afforded by the submarine cables
and the principal overland telegraph lines."</p>

<p><b>Index charts</b> are outline plans showing the area
covered by each chart of a series, and furnish a convenient
means of finding a chart of any desired region
or of selecting the most suitable chart for any purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
These index charts are published either in sets, showing
all the charts of a series, or are bound into the chart
catalogues.</p>

<p><b>Star charts</b> are included in navigational series,
and are conveniently arranged for use on shipboard
in identifying the brighter stars. The United States
Hydrographic Office publishes two, constellations of
the northern and of the southern hemispheres.</p>

<p><b>Explanatory sheets</b> are published in connection
with various series of charts, giving explanations of
the symbols and abbreviations used and of other
important features. In the United States the Coast
and Geodetic Survey has issued a small pamphlet,
"Notes on the use of charts," which contains explanations
of its chart symbols, and the Hydrographic Office
has published "A manual of conventional symbols and
abbreviations in use on the official charts of the principal
maritime nations."</p>

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
